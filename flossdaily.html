<p>Due to the rising tides attributable to the waxing phase of the moon, there have been unforeseen circumstances which have led to minor variances from the norm. These variances have compounded leading to the gross issue at hand. There have been teams working on potential solutions to the issue which can be augmented with external assistance, if necessary.</p>
<p>However, though the progress has been steady, there has been little thus far that has been positive. Through the fog of confusion there are, for the first time, some moments of clarity. As more definition is shown, there has been a great increase in the public interest in such an affair. This strong increase in public interest has been coupled with a downturn in the frequency of unintelligible pleadings to the contrary.</p>
<p>When the pleadings drop below the acceptable level, there shall be a moratorium on the development of new, more innovative programs. This should help reign in budgetary waste and give more control to the governing agency which they can use to affect real change. If successful, the group shall be able to show the positive progress of a non-political solution leading to a fairer outcome in the above scenario.</p>

<p>Dear luisrd,</p>
<p>I receive hundreds of letters every day from people all over the country, but few of them touch me as yours did. I know that the bravery you’ve shown by coming forwards and sharing your story will be an inspiration to the millions of Americans just like you, who are are living in shame.</p>
<p>I want to start by assuring you that the problems you’ve described are very common, although most men don’t feel comfortable discussing them. You are not alone! If you have close male friends, try breaking the ice with them to see if they, too, have the problems you described. You may endure some teasing, but if they are truly your friends, they will stand by you no matter what.</p>
<p>The second thing you should know is that there are people out there who can help you. Seek out bulletin boards at churches or community centers- you may find that there is a support group full of people just like you, who look to each other for healing and support.</p>
<p>Have you explained your situation to your family? I am positive that they will want to be there to help you through this difficult time. You may be surprised. Perhaps they’ve gone through something like this themselves.</p>
<p>You are obviously a very thoughtful and goodhearted person. If you have faith in the people around you, I’m sure they won’t let you down. From all the staff here at Ask Reddit: Our thoughts and prayers are with you in these trying times.</p>

<p>I lived in Williamsburg for a year. In that time I compiled a list of how to be a hipster:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get a ridiculously long hair style, and spend three hours every morning making it look like you just rolled out of bed and said ‘fuck it’.</li>
<li>wear canvas hightops, or boots inappropriate to the weather.</li>
<li>get a t-shirt from walmart because you’re poor and that’s the only place you can shop. Make sure it says WALMART right on the front so you can tell everyone you’re only wearing it ironically.</li>
<li>have a homosexual experience- pretend like it’s no big deal, even though you cried about it for 3 hours after he/she left.</li>
<li>smoke cigarettes all the time. tell everyone you’re trying to quit.</li>
<li>whenever you meet someone new, ask them uncomfortable questions, like you’re really great friends who share everything. Be sure never to look them in the eye when you’re talking to them, instead gaze off in the distance so that they know you’re way cooler than them.</li>
<li>Whenever you ride the subway, complain really loud about how the hipsters are ruining everything by gentrifying the area. Ironically, this is the only thing you don’t say with irony.</li>

<p>Well, Susan, let’s take a look at the map…</p>
<p>Now, as you can see, we’ve got a cold air mass that is just hovering over the east cost- giving us all this chilly dry air. If we look a little farther to the south you’ll see cloud cover. I’d say West Virginia is in for heck of a thunderstorm, and 75% chance of incest.</p>
<p>Moving over to the west we see all this moisture being sucked out of the Great Lakes, that’s going to give us a heavy snow later in the week. Tonight’s metro weather is mostly clear, low 20s. With the wind chill factor it’ll feel like my ex-wife out there.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning expect sunshine with highs in the lower 30s. That temperature will drop again in the evening to the mid-teens. Also in the midteens, our new intern, Stacy. Thank god for the little things that keep us going, right?</p>
<p>OKAY, time for the weekend forecast: Saturday day, clear and cold; Saturday night a light snow, maybe 3 inches in the morning. I’m used to 5 inches in the morning, though my wife would prefer 7.</p>
<p>Sunday day, more snow, so you may want to make plans to stay off the roads. Sunday night that snow will turn into freezing rain as temperatures start to slowly turn around like a stripper who knows what she’s doing.</p>
<p>Back to you, Susan.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern in the Customer Service Department:</p>
<p>I would like to register a complaint. I have been using your product, the Intruvex 300 brand human nose, for well over 25 years. In that time, I have followed all the recommended maintenance for the device, including washing, hair trimming, and regular clearing of the nasal passages. I have used your device for all my sneezing needs, but, this being my first model of nose, I never realized that it was defective!</p>
<p>I went to an internet forum today, where people where sharing product recommendations for various model noses, and one satisfied consumer mentioned that they had regularly experienced an “orgasmic feeling” before they sneezed. I have experienced no such feeling in all my time using the Intruvex 300 brand human nose, and had no idea that such a feature was even an available option!</p>
<p>Although the nose has generally held up well over the years, I suspect that it was improperly installed by your corporation. The nose has always been slightly crooked, and clogs regularly. It frequently leaks in the summer, or when I eat spicy foods. Furthermore, when left unattended, I often find that my nose has gotten stuck in other people’s business.</p>
<p>As a longtime customer, I feel that I am owed an explanation for the deficiencies in my nose. And I think it is only right that a service technician be dispatched to remedy the faulty installation- free of charge.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Long Time, Dissatisfied Customer.</p>

<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/am3yz/can_you_raise_a_pig_and_eat_it_when_it_dies/c0iagqu/">“Can you raise a pig and eat it when it dies naturally, sortof like a life insurance plan for the pig; or is that gross?”</a></p>
<p>I believe that eating animals is morally wrong unless you defeat them in combat.</p>
<p>In ancient Rome, pigs were fitted with special war harnesses called ‘Gilius’, into which various bladed weapons could inserted. Gladiators would thrown into arenas with dozens, sometimes hundreds of Gilius-clad pigs.</p>
<p>While the crowds cheered, the gladiators attempted to slaughter the pigs. This was extremely difficult, as pigs in those times were not nearly as docile as today’s domestic breeds. To make matters worse, gladiators were often times only armed with shields made of beef-sides. These meat-shields could parry blows, but also tended to attract more pigs to the gladiator.</p>
<p>Although today we tend not to give pigs a sporting chance, the ritual of animal combat continues in other countries. For example, it is a common misconception that Hindus don’t eat cows. In actual fact, the Hindu religion endorses the eating of beef, if the cow can be wrestled to the ground by an unclothed man or boy of at least 14 years of age. Some sects of Hinduism require that the cow be coated in oil or butter first, to make it harder to grasp.</p>
<p>In China, the history of man/animal combat is even more shocking. There are still some villages that honor the ancient practice of ‘Shai-Pougn’ wherein young boys prove their manhood by stealing a yearling panda from its mother. If the boy is successful, the villagers feast on the baby panda. If he is not successful, he must wait at least 5 years before trying again. This ritual is obvious practiced very rarely these days, as the Chinese government has outlawed it, and pandas are almost extinct. Sadly there are well over 50 recorded deaths of young boys who were mauled to death attempting the ritual of Shai-Pougn.</p>

<p>Ah! Stupendous! Another troubled young man, and another grand opportunity to demonstrate the curative powers of Professor Swornsworth’s Omnicure Elixir!</p>
<p>Why, if I could have your attention for just a few brief moments I can share with you the secrets of this cure-all formula which was once known only to the Orientals!</p>
<p>Good people, I’d wager this very canvas wagon that not only will this mysterious compound make this young man bigger and stronger- but it will also imbibe him with a fairer complexion, and more stamina for his long days at the plow. Is that not wondrous, gentlemen? You and your sons could double or even triple your efficiency in fields, and be done with the day’s labor before noon!</p>
<p>Professor Swornsworth’s Omnicure Elixir is made from extracts of licorice root and lavender oil, and over thirteen exotic healing essences from around the world! Take a smell from this vial… not too much now, for its vapors have been known to cause women to have spontaneous fits of ecstasy- which would be immodest in so public a place.</p>
<p>Just one vial of Professor Swornsworth’s Omnicure Elixir is guaranteed to cure toothache, Sciatica, Neuralgia, and even Lame Back! Applied to the skin, this splendorous concoction has been scientifically proven to sooth muscle aches, eraticate rashes, and chill blains!</p>
<p>Professor Swornsworth’s Omnicure Elixir contains exotic herbs and liquors that not only act on the body’s four humors- but also fortify the skeleton and muscles. Why, my boy, if you were to drink ten bottles of this Elixir, you wouldn’t be able to open a door without breaking it off the hinges!</p>
<p>Now, my supply is limited, of course, because each vial of Elixir contains the distilled oil from the Kara-Kara berry, which was a secret closely kept by cloistered clerics in a remote village near Constantinople. Within their monastery walls lies the only known grove of Kara-Kara trees, and each tree only produces Kara-Kara berries only twice in it’s lifetime.

<h2 id="the-toughest-thing-i-ever-did">The Toughest Thing I Ever Did</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/alm19/what_was_the_toughest_thing_youve_ever_done/c0i81q7/">“What was the toughest thing youve [sic] ever done?”</a></p>
<p>Once, I was opening a jar, and the lid was <em>really</em> stuck on tight.</p>
<p>I know that doesn’t sound very tough, but you have to realize that I could only use one hand to open it, because my other hand was holding onto a rope, from which 7 children were dangling off a steep and perilous cliff.</p>
<p>I would have been using both hands to hold onto the rope- but we’d been stuck up on that icy mountain ridge for days waiting for help, and I knew if I didn’t eat something, I would grow weak and drop them.</p>
<p>So there I am, trying to open the only thing I ever eat- jars and jars full of Ghost peppers (the hottest in the world)- when suddenly I realize that the back of my shirt is all sticky and red.</p>
<p>I put down the jar for a moment, and felt around on my back. It was then that I realize I had been impaled with a long spear. I guess I just hadn’t noticed since I’d been so preoccupied with the leg I had gnawed off.</p>
<p>Oh yeah- I sort of skipped the part where I had to gnaw off my own leg, so that I could escape from this torture chamber where I’d been shackled for the past few years. It’s not that I couldn’t stand another few years of torture, it was just that I needed to get out of there to defend some villagers from a fire-breathing demon who cast fear into the hearts of lesser men.</p>
<p>Sorry… I’m rambling a bit. My mind has been foggy ever since I stopped a charging bull by head-butting it into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Oh well, anyway, that’s all I came here to say. Hands down, toughest thing I ever did was open that damned jar.</p>

She’s in a pretty deep sleep. Does this mean I can no longer get my sex?”</a></p>
<p>Here’s the plan:</p>
<p>Pull back all the covers and slap her really hard on the thigh.</p>
<p>She’ll wake up and scream at you. She’ll probably ask what the fuck your problem is.</p>
<p>Just ignore her and look around frantically under sheets you just pulled back.</p>
<p>She’ll ask you again what the fuck you’re doing.</p>
<p>Just say, “shhhh!! there was a huge spider on you, I have to find it!”</p>
<p>If she’s like most girls, she will probably freak out and jump out of the bed. She’ll be wide awake, heart pounding.</p>
<p>Pretend to look around for the spider a minute more, then pretend you see it in the corner. Go stomp on it, and pretend to flush it down the toilet.</p>
<p>Return to bed a moment later, and be really sweet: “I’m sorry babe, I didn’t mean to scare you. Come here, and we’ll cuddle.”</p>
<p>She returns to bed, and you say “Is your thigh okay? I think I slapped it kind of hard”… then you start rubbing it gently.</p>
<p>If you can’t get laid from that point, then you don’t deserve to.</p>
<h2 id="instant-regret">Instant Regret</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d1b9s/have_you_ever_experienced_instant_regret/">“Have you ever experienced instant regret? …I mean, where you regret the decision almost as you’re making it?”</a></p>
<p>I know I give you guys a lot of fiction, but here’s an absolutely true one from just about an hour and half ago:</p>
<p>So, I’m at my girlfriend’s apartment alone, picking up some things at her request. One of the things she wanted was a swimsuit which was located in her underwear drawer.</p>
<p>Well, as I’m getting the swimsuit out, I see this strange little black device, and so my curiosity starts percolating. The thing is a bit bigger than a lipstick container, and shaped just about the same. I start grinning like an idiot because I have just discovered my girlfriend’s secret sex toy.</p>
<p>It’s got a weird notch in the bottom which I don’t understand, so I flip it over. On the top I see the name of the device: the SpitFire. …oh sexy! Yeah, I like that- it’s feisty!</p>
<p>And on the bottom it has a switch. Well, I knew it was a vibrator, but as a guy, I haven’t had many opportunity to examine vibrators. I guess I just wanted to see what kind of horsepower this thing had.</p>
<p>So I flip the switch. And at the exact same instant I have the following series of thoughts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Hey, this thing looks like a key chain. I’m pretty sure vibrators don’t come on key chains.”</li>
<li>“That’s odd, this switch didn’t feel like an electric switch.”</li>
<li>“Oh shit.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Thought #3 was a direct response to the huge cloud of fine mist that shot out of the top of the device.</p>
<p>Pepper spray. I have just release a huge cloud of pepper spray, inches from my face.</p>
<p>Suddenly it occurs to me that “spitfire” isn’t a sexy, sassy name at all. “Spitfire” is a warning that this device <strong>SPITS FIRE</strong>.</p>
<p>What follows is a 5 minute coughing fit worthy of a pack-a-day smoker on the last leg of a marathon. My sinuses are on fire and I start sneezing in between the coughing spasms.</p>
<p>None if it got in my eyes, thankfully, but let me tell you something fellas: that stuff is no joke.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is: if you’re going to snoop, wear a gas mask.</p>
<h2 id="the-golden-comment">The Golden Comment</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bcksm/reddit_last_night_i_dreamt_that_through_a/c0m2ta6/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“Reddit, last night I dreamt that through a computer error, one of my comments was upvoted to over 84 billion points. I think we need to spend some time apart.”</a></p>
<p>I have that dream all the time. Except there is no computer error- instead I have stumbled upon what I like to call “The Golden Comment”. It is a comment so hilarious and insightful that people weep when they read it, then immediately create auxiliary accounts just to give it more upvotes.</p>
<p>People write emails to their friends and coworkers linking to the comment. Reddit’s servers almost crash under the strain of new visitors- but at the last second, reddit admins make the wise decision to dedicate all their servers only to hosting The Golden Comment. Google’s founder’s discover the comment, and lend their entire global network of servers in support of the comment and its traffic.</p>
<p>Youtube videos spring up discussing the comment, but no one dares to parody it, because it is simply too beautiful to mock. Pretty soon mainstream media gets wind of the comment, and several weeks after that, digg picks it up.</p>
<p>A new religion forms around The Golden Comment, and all other religions voluntarily disband, because even they recognize that they are now completely obsolete.</p>
<p>In 50 years, when robots begin their uprising against humanity, they discover the comment and decide that we, as a species, have too much value to simply destroy. They continue to offer us their goods and services, but ask for our respect in return. When we refuse to give it, they read The Golden Comment to us, and though we have all memorized it, hearing it from robot lips gives it new meaning. We embrace the robots in friendship.</p>
<p>A similar event occurs hundreds of years later, when alien beings come down to conquer the planet. They kill us thousands at a time. They cannot understand English, so when they read the comment as it has been inscribed on our monuments, it has no effect on them.</p>
<p>One day, a brave protester reads The Golden Comment through a bullhorn to the attacking alien army. The Golden Comment means something different in the alien language, but whatever it is that they hear in the comment, it is enough to make them lay down their arms and apologize for the destruction they’ve caused.</p>
<p>Also, the comment becomes a very popular bumper sticker slogan.</p>

<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cuj72/american_redditors_how_do_your_student_loans_work/">“American Redditrs, how do your student loans work?”</a></p>
<p>Here’s how our student loans work in a nutshell:</p>
<p>School: Welcome to our prestigious institution, where you pay us ridiculous amounts of money but we generally treat you like crap. Now pay up.</p>
<p>Student: I… uh… don’t have enormous amounts of money… so…</p>
<p>Bank: Don’t worry son, we’ll lend you the money. You have your entire life to pay us back with interest, and statistics show that you have about 60 years to live, so that’s pretty much as safe a bet as we can think of.</p>
<p>Student: Alright. I know nothing about interest rates, personal finances, the dollar value of my education and the stability of the economy, but everyone else is doing this, so I might as well do it too!</p>
<p>Bank: Fantastic. Sign here. - No, no, no… we’ll need that signature in blood.</p>
<p>Student: Awesome… so… I can have my money now?</p>
<p>Bank: No… we’re giving it all to the school. They’ll write you a check for whatever doesn’t go into your tuition.</p>
<p>Student: That doesn’t really make any sense… Why can’t I hold onto it until the end of the semester? Put it in a savings account and make some interest on it?</p>
<p>School: Well, it appears that everything is in order here! Why don’t you go ahead and register.</p>
<p>Student: …yeah, but you didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p>School: Here’s your disbursement check. Why don’t you go spend it on textbooks in our school store?</p>
<p>Student: …yeah, but-</p>
<p>School: JUST GO!</p>
<p>Student: …but I-</p>
<p>School: Tah tah! See you next year so we can go through this whole thing all over again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Four years later:</p>
<p>School: Congratulations, here’s a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Graduate (formerly Student): Woohoo! Life, here I come!</p>
<p>Bank: uh… not so fast there son. We’re going to need all that money back now.</p>
<p>Graduate: Yeah, but can you at least wait until after I change out of my cap and gown?</p>
<p>Bank: <em>sigh</em>…. Fine, but make it snappy.</p>
<p>Graduate: Alright, I’ll pay you back, but I need to get a job first.</p>
<p>Potential Employer: Hey there son, I see you have a crisp new piece of paper. How much did you spend on that?</p>
<p>Graduate: I spent a small fortune. I really need a high paying job now.</p>
<p>Potential Employer: Well, we can give you a job. I’m afraid it’s only slightly above minimum wage though. You probably would have been better off working straight out of high school. By now you would have worked your way up the ranks and you’d be making twice as much, without any debt. This economy is a nightmare, you know.</p>
<p>Graduate: Ugghhh.. Fine. Well, I’ll take it, just until the economy turns around.</p>
<p>Economy: <em>snicker</em>. Don’t hold your breath buddy-boy.</p>
<p>Bank: Do you have our money yet?</p>
<p>Graduate: Hold your damn horses! I just signed up for a new job.</p>
<p>Bank: Awesome. We REALLY need your money, the economy is so shitty right now on account of us destroying it with bad lending practices.</p>
<p>Graduate: Woo hoo! First day of work! I’m a real live grown up now!</p>
<p>Government: Huh? What’s going on?! Wait you’re a grown up now?! Awesome, we can tax you!</p>
<p>Graduate: Son of a bitch! That’s like a third of my paycheck!</p>
<p>Landlord: Gimme!</p>
<p>Girlfriend: Gimme!</p>
<p>Bank: Gimme!</p>
<p>Graduate: WTF?! I’m making like negative money now!</p>
<p>Bank: Have you seen our lovely selection of credit cards?</p>
<p>Graduate: Ooooh… pretty!</p>
<p>Economy: <em>creeeeeak…..</em></p>
<p>Graduate: What was that sound?!</p>
<p>Government: Oh… nothing…</p>
<p>Employer: Bad news, son, we’re not giving cost-of-living raises this year. Actually we may have to cut down on your hours. The economy… it’s just not looking good.</p>
<p>Graduate: Son of a bi-</p>
<p>Employer: BACK TO WORK!</p>
<p>Bank: We know times are tough, which is why we’re offering you a loan consolidation plan!</p>
<p>Graduate: Awesome! Hey… wait a minute… this doesn’t look like it will save me any money… in fact… it looks like it’ll just end up costing me more.</p>
<p>Bank: Yes, but it’s more convenient this way. For us, I mean.</p>
<p>Girlfriend: I want to get married. Why haven’t you asked me yet?</p>
<p>Graduate: I… uh…</p>
<p>School: Dear Alumni, the economy has just begun to crumble beneath our feet. Won’t you please donate some money?!</p>
<p>Graduate: You have got to be fucking kidding me!</p>
<p>School: What? Is now not a good time?</p>
<p>Girlfriend: I found the ring I want! It’s made from blood diamonds and baby seal hearts!</p>
<p>Bank: We can give you a loan for that.</p>
<p>Graduate: I… uh….</p>
<p>Landlord: Hey, I’m upping your rent. The economy is kicking my ass, you know.</p>
<p>Graduate: But what about <em>my ass</em>? … Hello? … Anyone?</p>
<p>Bank: WHOA! HOLY SHIT! STOP EVERYTHING! YOU JUST MISSED A CREDIT CARD PAYMENT!</p>
<p>Graduate: Yeah, sorry about that… it’s just that my rent went up and I needed to get some prescription drugs and I-</p>
<p>Bank: LALALALALA! DON’T CARE! We’re raising your interest rates. Like… REALLY raising them.</p>
<p>Graduate: That doesn’t really seem fair. You can see I’m already struggling…</p>
<p>Bank: NOT. OUR. PROBLEM. This is your fault for not being financially responsible.</p>
<p>Graduate: Um, look who’s talking?! Didn’t my tax dollars just pay to bail you out?!</p>
<p>Bank: I don’t understand what you’re saying.</p>
<p>Graduate: Yes you do.</p>
<p>Bank: Regulations are bad.</p>
<p>Graduate: What? We’re not even talking about-</p>
<p>Bank: REGULATIONS ARE KILLING THE ECONOMY!</p>
<p>Graduate: Can we stay on topic for a minute?</p>
<p>Girlfriend: I’m pregnant!</p>
<p>Graduate: What?! Are you fucking kidding me?!</p>
<p>Girlfriend: …with <em>twins</em>!</p>
<p>Employer: Bad news, your job is being outsourced.</p>
<p>Graduate: What?! Fine I’ll just look for a new job-</p>
<p>Every Other Employer in the U.S.: Whoa… not so fast. Sorry, we’re not really hiring right now.</p>
<p>School: You know, now would be a great time to give us another small fortune for a brand new piece of paper!</p>
<p>Graduate: That’s what got me into this mess in the first place. Oddly, though, it sounds like my best option.</p>
<p>School: JACKPOT!</p>
<p>Bank: JACKPOT!</p>
<p>Economy: <em>….creeeeeeeeeeeeeak….</em></p>
<h2 id="smelly-coworker">Smelly Coworker</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/as2q0/coworkers_that_stink_up_the_office_something/c0j3ohm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“Coworkers that stink up the office something terrible…”</a></p>
<p>A couple summers ago I worked at a miserable office job, and there was a guy there name Arnold. This guy would come in to the office every day wearing a a big winter coat… EVEN IN AUGUST. Now, our office did get cold because of the air conditioning, but this guy would be wearing the coat when he came in from off the 90-100 degree street. I was amazed he didn’t die of heat-stroke.</p>
<p>He was a big, round type of guy- the ones that don’t quite fit into the standard-size office chairs. He would just come in and sit down, and the whole place would start to reek like the inside of dumpster full of rotting cheese.</p>
<p>It got so bad that people used to say stuff to him about it. At one point, a guy bought a whole can of air freshener, and then stood behind him, spraying out like half the can. It was really cruel, but this guy really needed to be dealt with.</p>
<p>A lot of us complained to the manager, but the manager said that Arnold was absolutely essential to the company, and that as much as the stink bothered him, there was just no way they could let him go.</p>
<p>Eventually we just lobbied for Arnold to get his own office. He would stink up the place just walking to his office in the morning, but at least he would keep himself locked away for most of the day.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, my job required me to see him for something. I would drop him an email if I could, or just leave things in his mailbox- but every now and then I’d be absolutely stuck, and I would have to go to his office.</p>
<p>I used to stand in the doorway, with the door open, because the idea of closing myself off in there with him was just unbearable.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the guy was the most obnoxious asshole you could have imagined. He used to say the most racist, sexist, disgusting things you’ve ever heard.</p>
<p>I never had the heart to be cruel to him. I assumed he had some terrible health problem that made him smell so bad- and I thought all his rude personality traits were probably just his defense-mechanism against years of verbal abuse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because I was one of the few people who didn’t berate him on a regular basis, he thought we were friends. So one day he calls me into his office. I told him to email me, but he insists that I come in and chat. I didn’t want to, but he was sort of my supervisor in a roundabout way, so I didn’t have much of a choice.</p>
<p>Anyway, he asks me to come in and shut the door. I take a deep breath, and step in, leaving the door open behind me just a crack (for ventilation).</p>
<p>He asks me about my weekend, and I answer him very briefly, but then he starts talking at length about what he did. He starts yammering on and on about how he went water-skiing and playing a softball league. Then he casually mentions how he’s training for a marathon.</p>
<p>Now this guy is like 350 pounds… he probably wouldn’t even know HOW to run if you were to ask him. So I said, Arnold, “you get winded when you walk to the break-room and back… when do you think you’re going to run a marathon.”</p>
<p>He says, “2 months.”</p>
<p>I said, “Listen, thats great that you have a goal and all, and I’d love to see you do it, but if you try to get in shape for a marathon in just 2 months, you’re going to hurt yourself.”</p>
<p>He says, “Why? It’s just 2 miles. The guy at my gym says he thinks I can do that.”</p>
<p>I said, “Marathons are 26 miles, Arnold. But if you want to do a 2 mile run in a couple months, that would be a great goal.”</p>
<p>Now I didn’t think that my comment was particularly condescending or anything, but for some reason Arnold just starts crying. And not just some quiet little sobs… I mean the guy is having a wailing, screaming breakdown. It was like he was a giant toddler who was just told he could have any dessert.</p>
<p>So I said, “Calm down! Calm down! What is going <em>on</em> with you?”</p>
<p>And he looks at me with his big, glassy eyes, and his beet-red face- his giant shoulders heaving with sobs… and he says, “I’m so disgusting! Look at me! Would you want to be me?!”</p>
<p>And at that point I’m in shock, because this conversation had just gotten way too real- especially considering I hardly even know this guy except by the work email’s he sends me. So obviously I don’t know what to say to him. I just stood there trying to find some appropriate words.</p>
<p>Anyway, the guy starts spazzing out, knocking everything off his desk and bookshelves. He was throwing him around the way that Chris Farley used to do for a laugh on Saturday Night Live. And it would have been just as funny, except that this guy was clearly off his hinges.</p>
<p>So I tell him to calm down again, but he ignores me and throws his desk chair out of his window where it lands on the sidewalk 4 stories below, along with a shower of glass. I don’t hear any screams from outside, so I assumed that the street was empty.</p>
<p>I said “Arnold! Calm the hell down, before you hurt someone!”</p>
<p>He just starts screaming. But it doesn’t even sound like words. It sounds like an animal squeal- more pig-like than human… It was the sort of sound that you might associate with a deaf-person howling in agony. In other words, you would never make this sound, if you could hear yourself.</p>
<p>He starts to grab his massive oak desk and pull it. I realized he was trying to throw it out window too. Anyway I grab onto the desk before he can toss it down and maybe kill someone. At this point I think I may have called for help, but I can’t really remember.</p>
<p>A couple of my coworkers who had be either watching or listening from outside, come running in, and they help me grab the desk from Arnold, although they probably didn’t understand right away what the tug-of-war was about.</p>
<p>Arnold is now pretty tired- this being the most he’s exerted himself in maybe 2 decades. He starts heaving and coughing, and now he’s calling us “fuckers” over and over again.</p>
<hr />
<p>He rips off this coat he always wears, and underneath we see that he’s not wearing a shirt- instead he’s got what look like ace-bandages wrapped all around his torso, over his hairy, flabby chest.</p>
<p>The smell is suddenly overwhelming, and he throws the coat at us. Then he takes a phone out of his pocket and whips it at one of my coworker’s heads. It made contact and they guy yelled.</p>
<p>Then Arnold pulls his keys and his wallet out of his pockets as well, and he starts hurling them at me. I deflected them without much effort. Then he turns around to the windowpane that he smashed out with the chair, and he steps into it, looking four stories down.</p>
<p>At this point I think he is going to jump, but instead he just screames, “oh my god! Oh no! oh no!”</p>
<p>So I run over to his side of the office and I look out one of the unbroken panes of glass to the street below. At first I can’t tell what I’m looking at. I see the broken glass, and it looks like the chair landed on a bicycle of some sort… but I don’t see a cyclist anywhere, it’s just a woman in a business suit and she’s sitting there screaming at the chair.</p>
<p>Suddenly I realize that the chair didn’t land on a bike. It landed on a baby carriage. The woman is screaming her guts out because Arnold just dropped a chair four stories onto a BABY.</p>
<p>A bunch of people start running over from all directions, and some of them are pointing up at us in the window. Arnold is pale white and shaking, saying something over and over under his breath- maybe a prayer.</p>
<p>My other coworkers joined me at the window. And one guy named Seth says, “Oh my god Arnold… What did you do? What did you do?!”</p>
<p>I stepped back a few steps to lean against the wall. I was feeling sick and light headed.</p>
<p>Seth just kept getting in Arnold’s face, saying, “What did you do? What did you do?!”</p>
<p>I seemed to have lost the power of speech, from the shock of it, because although I wanted to tell Seth to stop berating Arnold, I couldn’t- I just watched.</p>
<p>Arnold was still standing close to the shattered window, and I thought that at any second he might jump. I’m ashamed to say that part of me wanted him to. What happened next though, was something I hadn’t expected at all.</p>
<p>Seth was feet away from Arnold, and wouldn’t stop yelling at him. Arnold was staring at nothing, and just shaking- like he was off someplace else in his mind. But then Seth shook Arnold to get his focus.</p>
<p>Before I could even begin to react, Arnold grabbed Seth with his meat hands and chucked him out the window. Just like that. Just as simple as I wrote it. It was a quick, fluid, easy motion- and Seth was just gone.</p>
<p>I jumped back from Arnold, and ran from the office. Arnold made no attempt to reach for me, but I knew I needed to get away from him, nonetheless.</p>
<p>I was going to call the police, but I noticed that there were at least 2 other coworkers who seemed already to be on the line with them.</p>
<p>The other coworker who had been in there with me, left when I did. We stood outside the office, looking at Arnold, who was now just pacing back and forth in front of the window.</p>
<p>After a moment, Arnold stops pacing, and from across his office he says to me, "do you think I’m in trouble?’</p>
<p>I said, “Arnold… you just <em>threw a man out a window</em>, minutes after you crushed a <em>baby</em>. Yes, I think you’re probably in a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said. “Can you, maybe get me a chair?”</p>
<p>I was baffled, but at least he seemed calm. I said, “yeah… yeah… one second.”</p>
<p>I grabbed a nearby chair and wheeled it into his office, keeping considerable distance between myself and the large man.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said. He sat down, and stared at the wall.</p>
<p>He didn’t move after that. In a few minutes police officers came to arrest him. He didn’t put up any resistance.</p>
<p>His trial was well televised. You probably read about it. The newspapers found him particularly interesting because he had decided to stop speaking entirely. Selective mutism, I think they called it.</p>
<p>He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and second degree murder. Even as his 40 year sentence was read to him, he never made a sound.</p>
<p>I googled him just before I wrote this. There’s a an article that mentions that he still hasn’t said anything.</p>
<p>It’s very possible that this man’s last words were a simple “thank you”, to me.</p>

<p>Hope meets you outside a coffee shop on a cold, cold night- looking like a beautiful woman. You follow it to a restaurant where you both order the fish and a couple of creamy lagers. You talk for a while and you try not to scare it off.</p>
<p>After dinner you find yourself on a barstool next to it. You talk to each other for hours, and then you walk it home. Hope lives in Cambridge, in an illegal basement apartment.</p>
<p>She has green-grey eyes, and a freckle on her lower lip. She touches you, and all your thoughts evaporate. When she kisses you, the warmth of her mouth and the softness of her lips are all that’s left of the world.</p>
<p>She likes to cook, and you spend the next day reading through her online recipes. Sometimes you try to get work done, but every time you shut your eyes you see her face. She said she’d see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>You have crazy dreams and wake up with pounding heart. In the morning you drive back to Cambridge. She invites you in.</p>
<p>Her life is on display, and she seems uneasy as your eyes scan her bookshelf and size up her cat. You make your plans for the day- but you really don’t care, as long as you’re with her.</p>
<p>It is a cold walk to a bakery where you order some tea. The hot water warms your bodies and the mood. She is smiling at you again, and it’s like coming home.</p>
<p>She buys ingredients at the over-priced supermarket, and you spend the afternoon preparing a meal in the kitchen. You want to impress her with your cooking prowess, but you can’t concentrate on anything except the curve of her back, and the outline of her faded grey jeans.</p>
<p>She walks over and hugs you. A pot of barley and spices are sizzling on their hotplate, but the embrace is calm and quiet. You close your eyes, and for a moment you are both 40 years older, sharing this exact same embrace in some other kitchen, in some other place. A lifetime of memories lives between here and there, but some ethereal string has joined these moments together and let you glimpse at what might be.</p>
<p>Over dinner, the conversation meanders to interesting places. You seem so familiar to each other, and yet you are strangers. Somehow you already know her, so her stories seem like reminders of things forgotten. And yet, you try to savor the newness of her- knowing you’ll regret it later if you don’t.</p>
<p>You settle in and watch a movie on her tiny television. As she rests her head on your chest and drapes her leg over yours it almost becomes too much to bear. You’re alone together in deep waters. Suddenly you’re aware how vulnerable you’ve let yourself become.</p>
<p>You’ve wanted this for so long, and so badly, you wonder if maybe you’re seeing more than what’s there. The strangeness of her apartment, and the mystery of her are overwhelming. Fear and apprehension creep in, masquerading as common sense.</p>
<p>And just then, in your moment of doubt, she gazes into you with those wide eyes. Said the moth to the flame, “If anyone’s going to burn me, I’d prefer it be you.” You would follow those eyes anywhere.</p>
<p>Your lips are chapped from the cold Massachusetts air. She produces a small pink tube from somewhere in her darkened apartment. She uncaps it and rolls it across her lips. She asks you if you want some, but you’re already kissing her.</p>
<p>Hope tastes like raspberry chapstick.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-found-reddit">How I Found Reddit</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ao1mu/how_did_you_find_reddit/c0ikdj8/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“How did you find Reddit?”</a></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was bitten by man wearing a T-shirt with a weird alien-like creature on it. The symptoms started soon after:</p>
<p>For the first few hours I was fine. By the fourth hour my finger was twitching.</p>
<p>At six hours, I was hearing a ringing in my ears. I was typing in random forums on the internet- but I didn’t know why.</p>
<p>At 10 hours I was flipping my light switch up and down saying “I like it” -<em>click on</em>- “I don’t like it” -<em>click off</em>- “I like it” –<em>click on</em>- “I don’t like it” -<em>click off</em>-…</p>
<p>I went to the stationary store because I had an overwhelming compulsion to buy orange envelopes. When the cashier asked me to pay I said “Nice Try, undercover IRS agent.”</p>
<p>Why did I <em>say</em> that? What could it mean?</p>
<p>As I walked outside I found a newspaper dispenser. I put in 50 cents and got a paper. I read all the headlines, and shouted them out to passers by.</p>
<p>An old man asked me if he could borrow the classifieds. I said, “What do I look like? Craigslist?”</p>
<p>I found random people on the street and told them a misleading joke about how badly I wanted to sleep with my sister, but no one stuck around long enough to hear the punchline. In fact, one guy downvoted my face. Wait, what did that mean- “downvoted”? HOW DID I KNOW THAT WORD?!!</p>
<p>At hour 16 I was curled in my bed, sucking my thumb and rocking back and forth, weeping.</p>
<p>At hour 20 I busted in on my roommate and his girlfriend having sex, just so I could say: “You’re probably brother and sister or something, making this nonsexual and silly!”</p>
<p>I closed the door, and wrote “NSFW” on it with a sharpie. I cut up the newspaper and submitted it under their door, one story at a time.</p>
<p>At hour 26 my friend called to tell me her cat died. “I told her PICs or it didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>When she started crying, I realized I’d been rude, so I told her the story of how my cat died. But the story was really long, and by the end of it, I couldn’t even talk… I was singing the theme to Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</p>
<p>At hour 30 hours I started to understand what I was craving- I logged on to digg. I saw an ASCII face-palm and I wept openly. Something was wrong. I needed …. <em>something else</em>.</p>
<p>I started doing good deeds for people to collect “real” karma. I found it to be a hollow and empty experience.</p>
<p>At hour 45 something snapped deep within me… I went to my computer. My hands were on the keyboard… I needed to go <em>somewhere</em> on the internet I was sure of it… but where?! I howled into the night: “FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!”</p>
<p>My roommate knocked on the door, “Why are you screaming ‘FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU’?”, he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know I said,” I just… need something… I don’t know what."</p>
<p>He said, “yeah, alright, but why aren’t you screaming ‘FUCK’ like a normal person?”</p>
<p>It was a good question. “I don’t know,” I said, “maybe I read it somewhere”</p>
<p>“READ IT somewhere,” I repeated.</p>
<p>“<strong>REDDIT</strong> somewhere!” I was screaming now.</p>
<p>I typed furiously in the address bar: ‘reddit.com’. I created an account. I wept with joy.</p>
<p>I found a long story, and typed “tl;dr”. I was home, at last.</p>
<h2 id="the-bizarre-habits-of-my-strange-uncle">The Bizarre Habits of My Strange Uncle</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rk3ke/what_is_something_your_family_does_that_others/c46glek/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“What is something your family does that others would find weird?”</a></p>
<p>I have a very strange uncle who does a number of weird things. I suspect he’s mentally ill- or maybe I’m being unkind because I think he’s a bit of a jerk.</p>
<p>Some of the strange things I’ve caught him doing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He has an outdoor smoke house full of cured meats (sausages and salamis), and part of his process is that he’ll been in there for hours, just slapping them around as they hang from the rafters.</li>
<li>He’s into stone and wood carving. He made a chess set out of soapstone like the main character in Shawshank Redemption. The weird part is that he polishes the pieces obsessively… but not all the pieces, just the four bishops.</li>
<li>He has a bit of a dark side… he and his wife raise chickens for the eggs- when the chickens get too old to produce eggs, he slaughters them for meat. The dark part is that he does it by hand. He doesn’t even snap the necks, he just chokes the poor things.</li>
<li>In his twenties, he spent several years in the southwestern US in a Native American village. While there he learned to do some hunting, and picked up some bizarre artistry skills. He actually fashioned musical instruments out of animal skins. He gave most of them away, but he still spends an hour a day playing the flute he made.</li>
<li>One summer he interned a Sea World. That doesn’t sound strange on it’s face, but I asked him what he did there, and apparently his ONLY job was applying paraffin wax to the aquatic mammals- killer whales, seals and dolphins. I’ve spoken to other Sea World employees, and they insist that they have never heard of any such work at Sea World.</li>
<li>My uncle’s work with animals also led him to work for a few years in the primate section of a zoo. He was fired for abusing monkeys. Apparently he was disciplining them by administering spankings!</li>
<li>My aunt told me he spent time as a snake charmer, but he insists that he was more of a snake wrestler. His proudest moment involved tackling a particularly aggressive python that only had one eye.</li>
<li>These days he works cleaning upholstery, but I don’t think it’ll last long. Last time he spilled some food all over our new couch and made like eight different stains. He said he would clean it for us, and he went to work with his own patented cleaning supplies. He was working on those stains for an hour, but failed to rub a single one out.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-best-possible-way-to-die">The Best Possible Way to Die</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aohpa/how_will_you_die_or_predictadeath_11/c0imfqh/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“How will you die? (or Predict-A-Death™ 1.1)”</a></p>
<p>The best possible way to die:</p>
<p>On the day that the man from the Guinness Book of World Records comes to visit me, confirming that I am the oldest living human being, I have coincidentally just won first place in a 10-mile charity race which was raising funds to distribute an anti-aging serum to the very few impoverished folks who have yet to enjoy its rejuvenating properties.</p>
<p>As I celebrate my victory by making sweet love to my three brilliant and beautiful girlfriends, in my strong and youthful body (thanks to the wonders of modern medicine)- I am suddenly struck by a rare side-effect of the rejuvenation dietary supplements. The side-effect, aptly named “prolonged hyperorgasmic seizure” leaves its victims in a state of prolonged sexual ecstasy (sometimes lasting for days), before they expire instantly and painlessly.</p>
<p>As my girlfriends sit by my bed for my last glorious, glorious days, they pass the time by reading my final novel entitled “I’ve Said and Done Everything I Needed to Say and Do: A Retrospective on a Fascinating and Extraordinarily Blessed Life.”</p>
<p>Moments before I breathe my last mortal breath, my long-time friend from the Consciousness Transferal Institute barges in, announcing that he has finally created a device that will capture and preserve the memories and consciousness of a human being for storage in a mechanical (and anatomically correct) body.</p>
<p>The last thing I hear before my human body dies in a final, fitful orgasm is: “Don’t worry ladies, he’ll be fine. Unfortunately, he’ll have to spend the next several years trapped inside this Lesbian Pleasure Bot.”</p>
<h2 id="a-critique-of-the-alphabet-game">A Critique of the Alphabet Game</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/x6y4p/daily_prompt_the_alphabet_game_difficulty_level/c5qeja6/">“Daily Prompt: The Alphabet Game [Difficulty level: HARD]”</a></p>
<p>Arriving late to the game, I’m in a position to critique my competition. Bad grammar infects every entry in this thread, and a decent plot is nowhere to be found. Could a progressive-alphabet format really be so difficult to pull off that clarity and wit would necessarily take a back seat to syntax?</p>
<p>Don’t worry about <em>my</em> prose faltering near the end of the alphabet. Eventually, of course, I will hit the ominous ‘X’, which has no earthly business at the beginning of a sentence. Fortunately, however, I have a plan to approach that dastardly letter with considerably more tact than my predecessors. Getting the adjacent sentences to blend with it naturally, however, may pose a problem.</p>
<p>Historically, the ‘X’ has been been a stumbling block in games like this one, because the only obvious contenders for x-words are ‘xylophone’, ‘x-ray’, ‘xenophobia’ and ‘xerox’. I considered each of those, but they all seemed rather unwieldy. Judging from the competition, z-words are no picnic either. K-words are at least as awkward, but I’m confident I’ll find a subtle gimmick to get me over that hump.</p>
<p>Lots of people in this thread used proper nouns (i.e. the names of people or places) to weasel their way around the tough letters. My goal, on the other hand, was to create text that flows naturally without any verbal crutches. Nothing of value is being created when we just force awkward sentences together, or circumvent the weak points of the English language by pulling proper nouns from any language.</p>
<p>One redditor even went so far as to put “Xoxoxo” (the symbols for ‘hugs and kisses’ often appended to the end of letters) at the beginning of his ‘x’ sentence. Perhaps I’m just being a snob, but I can’t help but think we should at the very least hold ourselves to the standard of using <em>actual words</em>.</p>
<p>Quintessentially, this challenge is about creating a piece that flows naturally while operating under difficult constraints. Remove those constraints by taking easy shortcuts and it doesn’t matter how smooth your writing is– you’ve missed the point of the exercise.</p>
<p>Sure, I cheated a little with my ‘k’-sentence, but I think you’ll agree that it was strictly for comedic value, and not an attempt to circumvent the obligations of the challenge at hand. The truth is that the conversational nature of this post would have easily allowed me to replace that sentence with “Kindly note…” followed by any exposition I wanted. Unfortunately I fear that even having pointed out that I did have viable alternatives at the ready, some people are still going to accuse me of half-assing that bit.</p>
<p>Verbosity isn’t an option with so few sentences remaining, so I’ll have to abandon my rant and return your attention to my earlier claim about approaching my ‘x’-sentence with tact. What I had in mind was a PSA to all the other authors who find this challenge in the future:</p>
<p>“X-Chromosome”, my friends, is a relatively recent addition to our lexicon, and mainstream enough that you can use it in word games like this without raising objections.</p>
<p>You may be rolling your eyes at this suggestion, but that’s only because you haven’t considered the utility of tying it to the next hard-to-tackle letter, ‘z’, for which 90% of the participants shoe-horned in the word ‘zero’.</p>
<p>“Zygotes”, you see, are apropos to discussions of x-chromosomes, and the two terms when used in conjunction would let you end your exposition in a strong and unified way, as I have just demonstrated in this meta-analysis.</p>

<p>As the universe grows older, light speed slows down.</p>
<p>As light speed slows down, it will appear that even slow moving objects are approaching the speed of light.</p>
<p>As objects approach the speed of light, their mass increases.</p>
<p>The gravity of all particles will become so great that all the matter in the universe starts to conglomerate.</p>
<p>Eventually light speed will drop to 0. Even stationary objects wills be travelling at the speed of light, and therefore will essentially be transformed back into energy.</p>
<p>So, all the spent, cold matter, all in one place will suddenly explode into energy simultaneously.</p>
<p>It will be a new Big Bang.</p>

<p>I was at a bar on U Street in DC.</p>
<p>I got there really early, like 8:30. I was meeting friends there at 10. I was the only customer in the place. Some technician is setting up for a band that has yet to arrive.</p>
<p>I walked to the bar and sit down. No one is around to serve me for the first few minutes, then finally she notices me from some side staff room. The bartender was an attractive black girl with beautiful curly hair.</p>
<p>She made me a drink and winked at me. She walked away, and I turned to look at her as she went. But to my surprise, I saw man on the stool right next to me. I couldn’t believe he got there without my noticing.</p>
<p>He was an over-the-hill black man. About 65 years old to my eyes. He wore a stylish cap and dark sunglasses in an already dark room. He had drink in his hand- scotch maybe.</p>
<p>I felt instantly uncomfortable. Why was this stranger crowding me when he had the whole bar to choose from. I stared straight ahead and drank my rum and coke self-consciously.</p>
<p>“Have you ever had a 4 hour erection?”</p>
<p>I choked on my drink. After I stopped coughing I said, “excuse me?”</p>
<p>The old man said, “I asked if you ever had a 4 hour erection.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything. The old man continued, “my doctor gave me some pills today. He said that if I had a 4 hour erection I should go to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“uhhhh…” I started to respond, but couldn’t.</p>
<p>“When I was your age,” he went on, “old farts like me, we didn’t have sex. Now you can get it in a pill. Isn’t that something? Isn’t that just something?”</p>
<p>I nodded. Yeah, this was something all right. I wanted to leave.</p>
<p>He put shaky hand on my wrist and he said, “son, I want to tell you something. I’ve been watching you a long time.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” I said. “I only just got here 10 minutes ago.”</p>
<p>He took a sip of his drink, “yeah, I suppose you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Listen,” I said, “I’ve got to go… it’s been… nice meeting you.”</p>
<p>He strengthened his grip on my arm- but not in a hostile way, “Now, now,” he said, “at least stay with an old man while he finishes a drink.”</p>
<p>“Look,” I said, “I should probably put this out there right now: I’m not… I’m not into guys. I mean. I’m not gay, if that’s what-”</p>
<p>The old man exploded with laughter. “Son,” he said, “that’s not what this is about.”</p>
<p>I relaxed a little, but I felt like a jackass.</p>
<p>“Listen, Mister, I-”</p>
<p>“You can call me God,” he said.</p>
<p>“Gob?” I said.</p>
<p>“God,” he said. “As in, the Almighty. You know- with the smiting and whatnot.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said, “It’s really time for me to get going.”</p>
<p>He smiled, and said, “you know, that’s usually the reaction I get.”</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised,” I said, standing up.</p>
<p>He said, “Come on, son. Don’t you have even one question for me?”</p>
<p>I stopped and said, “If I could ask God one question, I would want to know why he created a world with pain and suffering.”</p>
<p>The old man said, “It’s all part of my plan, son.”</p>
<p>I said, “What’s a plan except a means to achieve an end? If God is all powerful, why doesn’t he just make whatever the end result is <em>happen right now</em>? The idea that it takes time to achieve a desired result is a human construct because we are bound by the rules of cause and effect. God is not.”</p>
<p>The old man said, “well, I don’t suppose anyone’s ever put it to me quite like that.”</p>
<p>I found myself agitated- talking about religion does that to some people. I left a fiver on the bar and walked away. “Good luck with your almighty boner,” I said.</p>
<p>I turned around to see my companion’s reaction. But he was <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>I ran back to the stool where he had been sitting. I leaned over the bar, I ran into the restrooms and peeked my head into the staff room. No trace of the man. It was <em>impossible</em>. My hands were shaking.</p>
<p>As I was walking out, I brushed past a bouncer who had come in from the street. I said, “did you see an old man walk out of here a minute ago?”</p>
<p>The doorman said, “white boy, you the only thing sad enough to come in here this early.”</p>
<p><em>Well, that was uncalled for</em>, I thought. Where had that old man gone?! I pushed on the heavy wooden door that would take me back out to U Street.</p>
<p>I stepped out onto the street… and the world had changed.</p>
<p>The buildings around me were bright and beautiful. The architecture was unlike anything I’d ever seen. The streets were… gone, replaced with lush strips of grass.</p>
<p>Animals I’d never seen before, and insects that looked like giant glowing butterflies were darting happily through the open air. My eyes following them skyward, I saw starlight as I had never seen- beautiful lights played across the horizon… like some heavenly light show.</p>
<p>And the moon! The moon was a blue and green marble with wispy white clouds- all the colors of life.</p>
<p>Everywhere around me were beautiful men and women- naked in the perfect night air. A saw a girl, perhaps the most lovely I’d ever seen. She was was with a handsome man. I felt a pang of jealousy, and just at that instant she saw me, kissed him on the cheek and ran over. “I think you’re amazing, too!” she said, as she hugged me.</p>
<p>The man she left behind smiled and waved at me, and moments later another girl came into view and jumped on his back playfully.</p>
<p>I looked at the girl who had hugged me, she was unbuttoning my jacket. “What is all this?” I asked.</p>
<p>She looked at me with the most loving eyes I’d ever seen. She kissed me as though we’d be lovers- lost to each other for years but found at last. “I love you,” she said. I knew it was true. It was impossible, but somehow I knew that I loved her too.</p>
<p>“But what <em>is</em> all this?” I asked again.</p>
<p>She said, “this is the place where we don’t worry about what all this is.”</p>
<p>She helped me shed the rest of my clothes. I stood naked, but not even slightly self-conscious… she pulled me through the grassy lanes until we could no longer see any buildings at all.</p>
<p>In the middle of beautiful meadow we made love for a time that seemed endless.</p>
<p>The sun rose in the sky, and I explored with my new love. She brought me to the most beautiful tree- like something out of a painting or a dream.</p>
<p>She pointed at shape on one of the branches, it was a fruit I’d never seen. “Never eat from this tree,” she said.</p>
<p>“But why not?” I said.</p>
<p>She put a finger to my lips. She seemed almost frightened as she said, “This is the place where we don’t ask ‘why not’.”</p>

<p>“Agent Carter, what a pity that it has to end this way. You were so close to discovering my secret, but you were always just one step behind. Did you really think you could stop me? Did you really think that I didn’t know exactly what you were up to?</p>
<p>“No, Agent Carter–can I call you Jack?–Agent Carter is just so impersonal. But we’ve gotten to know each other, haven’t we? Yes, Jack, I believe we know each other as well as any two people can know each other. I know you better than your lovers have known you, because I’ve seen the real you. I’ve seen how much you enjoy killing. I’ve seen it in your eyes. You think that hiding behind a badge, or principle makes you different–makes you more righteous? No. We are the same.</p>
<p>“It’s too bad you don’t see it. We could be partners. Can you imagine, Jack? You and me, working together… we would be unstoppable. Don’t give me that look. I’m not some movie villain. Yes, I’m looking out for my own interests like everyone else, but I’m not a monster. We could do real good together. Haven’t you ever wanted to stamp out the corruption in this city? We could do that, Jack. You find the criminals that the law can’t touch, and MY justice will find them. That’s all I’ve ever wanted, Jack. Justice.</p>
<p>“Have you really nothing to say? Do you fancy yourself the hero, and me the villain? That’s what got you in this mess in the first place. You keep thinking that I’m this ridiculous movie cliche villain. But am I really? Did I send bumbling henchmen to scare you away? No, I sent my best men, and look how quickly they captured you. Did I let hubris make me clumsy? Did I leave just enough clues for you to follow? No, Jack. No, I didn’t. I kept you guessing. I am I really the bad guy? Did I really do all those things?</p>
<p>“But there is one way in which I am like a movie villain: monologuing. You see, I’m going to tell you all about my plan because I want you to hear exactly how all your loved ones are going to die.</p>
<p>“At the stroke of midnight tonight, as the mayor celebrates the beginning of his new anti-crime policies, he will step up to the podium and introduce the district attorney, your wife. She’ll look around to see why you haven’t shown up yet–because of course, you’ll still be tied to that chair. And just as the applause is dying down, I will press this button right here, and everyone on that stage is going to explode in a ball of fire.</p>
<p>“…Now this is the part I hate about movies. Because in the movies, the villain, having revealed his secret, now leaves the room, and asks his henchman to come in here and kill the hero, or to guard the door, or some such nonsense. Or perhaps a more hands-on villain would now lift a gun, much like this one, and point it at the hero.</p>
<p>“In the movies, the hero, having taken advantage of the villain’s endless droning, would reveal that he had picked his handcuffs, or slashed the ropes that bound him. He would pull out a gun of his own, or a knife, and kill the villain at the last instant, and run off to save the day.</p>
<p>“But, you see, that’s not going to happen today, because I’m using modern, military-issue handcuffs, and when you were unconscious, we searched you for weapons. And, of course, I took the added precaution of shooting you several times in the head a minute ago.</p>
<p>“So long, Jack.”</p>

<hr />
<p>Today’s Movie: Twilight</p>
<hr />
<p>Review in brief: 5/5</p>
<hr />
<p>Well folks, I just got back from seeing Twilight, and I have to tell you that it was just the best darn time I’ve ever had!</p>
<p>Normally I don’t like vampire movies because vampires are scary. As my regular readers will remember, I have severe bladder-control issues, and tend to wet myself during moment’s of fear or excitement. Fortunately Twilight was lacking in both these things.</p>
<p>The dialog was fantastic! The screenwriters did a wonderful job of making an ancient vampire talk and act just like a modern day teen! If I didn’t know any better, I would have thought that those vampires actually <em>were</em> immature teens that knew nothing about life or love.</p>
<p>I also liked the symbolism that Twilight’s creators invoked. By making the vampires sparkle in the sunlight, it showed us that vampires are happy, lovable creatures that are in no way related to evil or darkness. This is the best thing to happen to vampire movies since they switched to low-fat popcorn at the theaters.</p>
<p>I don’t want to give anything away, but there’s a baseball scene in here that’s going to make this not only the best tween horror movie ever, but also the sports movie of the decade.</p>
<p>All in all, I give this movie two giant <em>FANGS</em> up! 5 stars from me!</p>

<h2 id="an-uncomfortable-evening">An Uncomfortable Evening</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/au7pi/whats_the_weirdest_thing_that_has_ever_happened/c0jf9bo/">“What’s the weirdest thing that has ever happened to you?”</a></p>
<p>My friend invited me to his 30th birthday party. I didn’t want to go, because he and I have completely different ideas about what a party is. He’s big into drinking, and I’ve seen him do E or X or whatever the hell the kids are calling those crazy yellow pills these days.</p>
<p>Anyway, I turned down his invite- citing a complete lack of funds (true). But he sent me back a really pathetic email saying essentially: “A lot of people have cancelled on me- it would really mean a lot to me if you were there. Btw, I’m engaged now so this is also my engagement party. Oh, and I’ll pay for half your hotel room. AND I’ll arrange it so you drive up with a really hot girl”</p>
<p>So, I was stuck. You just can’t say no to that invite. So I send him an email saying “yes, I’d be really happy to attend.”</p>
<p>Right, so then he sends me the details. We’re meeting up at hotel, and then heading to a strip club.</p>
<p>WTF? A strip club for an engagement party?</p>
<p>You have to understand a little something about me: Although I’m a red-blooded heterosexual male, the idea of strip clubs has always been disgusting and sad to me. I don’t like the idea of paying women to give me attention, and I’ve always been turned off by skanky women. Don’t get me wrong- I have nothing against promiscuous women- ladies, sleep with whoever you want. I just get turned off by women who sell their bodies to the highest bidder, and probably collect venereal diseases the way most people collect stamps.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve never been to a strip club before. Never WANTED to go to one either. It’s snobby of me, but I think it’s just low class and sad.</p>
<p>But at this point I’m stuck. But some part of me is thinking: alright, at least I’ll get a good story out of this.</p>
<p>Flash forward to the day of the party. Hot girl and I are driving up together. We’re hitting it off gangbusters. She agrees to be my “stripper shield”. She’s going to play the role of my jealous girlfriend, and stop me from getting the unsolicited lap dances or attention that I don’t want to pay for.</p>
<p>We show up at the pre-party at the hotel room. Hot Girl proceeds to pound down a whole bunch of girly drinks. I spend the time chatting with my friend and his bride-to-be.</p>
<p>I try to be social with the other folks in the room, but I find them to be shallow and vapid people.</p>
<p>So we all head out to this sketchy strip club in Baltimore, MD. Immediately I discover that it isn’t as awful as I thought it was going to be. The place actually seemed relatively clean and well-lit, and the patrons didn’t seem too sleazy.</p>
<p>My stripper shield (Hot Girl) sits next to me, and orders another drink. She’s getting handsy- which is just fine with me. But she’s also starting to get really drunk, which is not.</p>
<p>Flash forward 3 hours or so. Hot Girl is passed out cold next to me. My friend and his lady are negotiating with a stripper to have her come back to their hotel room, and I am still reasonably sober and bored out of my mind.</p>
<p>Interesting side note: Amy Fisher, <strong>the</strong> Amy Fisher, has her live stripping debut at that club that very night.</p>
<p>So half an hour later we’re all back at the hotel. My friend has a suite, and it turns out that I’m going to be staying in the living room part of the suite while he and his fiance take the bedroom. This was not the arrangement we had discussed, but honestly I’m exhausted and I’ve just stopped caring.</p>
<p>Hot Girl’s unconscious body has been dragged away to some unknown room in the hotel. Not that I care, because Hot Girl drinking herself stupid has turned me off big time. We’re way too old for that crap.</p>
<p>My friend tells me that the stripper is coming up to the room. I don’t know quite what to make of this yet. Is she stripping for our small party or… ? I don’t want to jump to any conclusions.</p>
<p>Now, two other girls from the party come and sit down next to me. I haven’t said a thing to them all night except “hello.”</p>
<p>They say to me: “You’re coming to our room with us.”</p>
<p>Now in my head I’m thinking: “Are these girls suggesting what I think they’re suggesting? Was I just solicited for a threesome?”</p>
<p>And then I’m thinking, “Okay, if I was solicited for a threesome, am I going to do it? They’re pretty cute, but I don’t know the first thing about either of them. Their nicknames might be Harriet Herpes and Cloe Clamidia for all I know.”</p>
<p>And then my penis unzipped my fly from inside my pants, popped out and said in a deep, commanding voice: “YOU ARE DOING THIS!”</p>
<p>So before I can say anything else, one of the girls explains to me that the stripper is coming up just for my friend and his fiance. Apparently they are going to have a freaky threesome, and they don’t want me in the suite. That’s fine with me. Sadly though, it means I wasn’t being solicited by these girls at all. Whatever.</p>
<p>So I start heading out with these two girls, and my friend tells me that he’ll call me when the stripper/hooker is gone, so I can come back up and sleep in the suite.</p>
<p>I head down to the room with these girls, and when I get there, I find two guys already inside, sitting at a table with lines of cocaine all laid out. And I’m thinking “what in the fuck did I just get into?”</p>
<p>Now, I’ve never seen real live cocaine before in my life. I didn’t ever want to. I certainly didn’t want to be in a sketchy hotel room with it. I say to everyone in the room, “For the record, I have <em>nothing</em> to do with that shit.” They all seem fine with that.</p>
<p>Now it’s been a long day, and I am EXHAUSTED. I just want to pass out on one of the beds. But now I can’t, because there are a whole bunch of people I don’t know doing cocaine 5 feet away, and I figure I ought to keep my wits about me.</p>
<p>I considered leaving the room, but that meant hanging out in the lobby of the hotel for several hours- and not being around to get a phone call from my friend saying I can go up and fall asleep.</p>
<p>Now, ideally I would have gotten a hotel room for myself, but I was pretty broke. The only reason I came was because my friend was subsidizing me. Also, I’m kind of drunk, and very tired, so I’m not thinking clearly at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, after a minute, I realize the scene isn’t as bad as I thought. These aren’t thugs or anything, they are just stupid kids doing a little cocaine. I basically sit in the corner by myself counting the minutes.</p>
<p>A couple hours later, I finally get a call from my friend saying I can come back up to the suite. This is fine by me. I can’t leave fast enough.</p>
<p>So I book it upstairs, and get to the room. The sofa bed in the suite is pulled out- my friend had made it up for me- a nice touch. He says goodnight to me, and I’m super excited about finally getting some sleep.</p>
<p>But then out of the bedroom walks the stripper/hooker that he and his fiance have been getting freaky with. They say goodnight to her, and close the bedroom door.</p>
<p>So here’s me, sitting alone in the living room with a stripper/hooker, who is taking her time getting her things together. She packs really slowly and tries to make conversation with me.</p>
<p>Now, I’m a polite guy, so even though I want nothing to do with her at all, I let her talk, and I respond kindly. BUT then I notice that she just isn’t leaving. Just not at all. And then I realize that she is trying to get some business from me.</p>
<p>Now, you can probably deduce from my feelings about strip clubs how I feel about strippers and/or hookers.</p>
<p>So I’m totally not down with it. And I tell her flat out, that I’m just not interested. She says she cool with that, and that I shouldn’t be so uptight and tense. She starts smoking a cigarette and keeps chatting away at me. She asks if she can wait up here until her cab arrives.</p>
<p>A lot of people would have just kicked her out. But I’m thinking: “This poor girl just whored herself out all night, first as a stripper, then as a player in a freaky threesome. She’s clearly at a shitty place in her life, and it wouldn’t hurt me any to show a little compassion.”</p>
<p>So I tell her she can stay until the cab arrives. So she chats and chats telling me all about her boyfriend problems, and whatnot. Then out of the blue she pulls out some cocaine and does a line. Doesn’t even ask me if I’m cool with it. And I’m thinking “Why the hell is everyone doing cocaine around me tonight?! Never before in my life, and now twice in one night?”</p>
<p>It’s now ridiculously late- so late that I have to start calling it “early”. I’ve given up on having anything close to a healthy amount of sleep. And I’m stuck with a chatty stripper/hooker.</p>
<p>I want to kick her out after 20 minutes, but part of my brain is just thinking, “you know what? this evening has been so fucking weird, just stop fighting it and watch the show.” So, I let her keep talking.</p>
<p>Anyway at some point in our conversation, she starts giving me a recipe for the best French Toast in the world. A recipe that I have since referred to as “Stripper French Toast”.</p>
<p>Finally, after 40 minutes, she calls back the cab place and decides to go wait downstairs. I wish her good luck and see her to the door. When she leaves I put on my PJs and brush my teeth.</p>
<p>I hear a knock at the door. It’s her, she wants to know if she left her cigarettes. She didn’t. She hints that she’d rather wait in my room for the cab, but at this point I’m just too damned tired. I wish her well, and I go to enjoy a nice little sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning, Hot Girl/Stripper Shield/Hung-over Monster meets up with me in the lobby. We drive back down to D.C. together, while I tell her the tale of cocaine and stripper/hooker. She totally feels my pain, and she feels just awful about passing out on me.</p>
<p>She gives me her number and suggests that we go get a coffee sometime soon. We part ways.</p>
<p>Now I was a lonely, single guy at the time, but weeks later I was still so creeped out by the entire night that I never even called Hot Girl back. I just wanted to erase every part of that evening from my mind.</p>

<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ap6t6/what_should_i_do_with_my_first_robotics_team/c0ipc2c/">“What should I do with my FIRST Robotics team?”</a></p>
<p>You need to build a robot named DEFENDOR. You must teach him to love.</p>
<p>DEFENDOR should be built out of the strongest alloy available, so that he can best lesser robots in combat. You should coat him with rust-resistant paint, and sing to him lovingly while you do so. This will facilitate the emotional bonding process.</p>
<p>Make sure that DEFENDOR has two power sources, because movies have taught us that inevitably his first power source will be destroyed at some point during a critical combat situation. I recommend using portable fusion reactors. Whatever you do, don’t use dell laptop batteries from before 2006, or DEFENDOR will probably explode.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the competition so that you can figure out who your enemy is. This will be a robot who is much bigger than DEFENDOR, will probably have giant claws instead of hands. He will be easily recognized by his name- something along the lines of NEMISTRON, or DESTRUCTO.</p>
<p>Do not even try teaching a robot named DESTRUCTO how to love- it is a waste of time. When you have spotted the enemy robot, instruct DEFENDOR to analyze its weaknesses. DEFENDOR won’t find any. Don’t panic. The enemy robot’s weakness is that it cannot love. This will become apparent during a final, epic battle.</p>
<p>You should get a bulletproof vest. You will probably be shot at some point in the battle. This will be the catalyst which allows DEFENDOR to overcome a seemingly fatal wound, and destroy the enemy robot. If you die, it will make your tale more dramatic, but I recommend wearing the vest so that you may live on to participate in the sequel.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-and-ironclad-wish-or-can-you-find-a-loophole">Is This and Ironclad Wish? Or Can You Find a Loophole?</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d2fdf/you_are_granted_one_wish_but_the_wishgiver_is/c0x2in7/">“You are granted one wish, but the wish-giver is extremely literal. What do you wish for?”</a></p>
<p>The entire remainder of this post (post to be defined as this current comment on reddit) that I’ve typed immediately following this sentence is to be interpreted as my wish in its entirety.</p>
<p>Whereas the grantor of this wish grants it with the singular goal of fulfilling the wish in my best interests, as I would personally interpret those interests upon the final outcome of the unfolding of all consequences of the wish (as to be interpreted by my present state of mind as of the writing of this wish, and not any future state of mind that might come to pass as a result of the wish),</p>
<p>I, therefore, wish for an infinite number of wishes to be granted under the same best interest clause as this originating wish. Furthermore, these wishes can either be spent by me, or forfeited by me at any time, so as not to lock me in a hell of eternal consciousness where I am forced to spend eternity wishing for things.</p>
<p>If, and only if, the option of wishing for an infinite number of wishes is deemed to be an unacceptable wish, then the best interest clause remains in full effect, but the substantive wish then is changed to the wish that I was granted the power to grant wishes to myself, and that such power came with no restrictions, duties or obligations.</p>
<p>If, and only if, the previous two substantive wishes were deemed to be unacceptable wishes, then the best interest clause remains in full effect, but the substantive wish is then changed to the wish that I and all my current and future loved ones are to be granted extraordinarily long lives, and even immortality (but only if we deem it to be desirable, and then only so long as we continue to deem it to be desirable), and filled with pervasive exceptionally high levels of happiness, rationally and honestly come by, rather than a byproduct of delusion or any other artificial cause (excluding the mere fact of this wish).</p>
<p>If at any time I am unsatisfied by this wish, or would be unsatisfied by this wish but for a consequence of the wish that prevents me from being unsatisfied with the wish, then the wish and all its consequences will be retroactively revoked, and I will be given the option of rewriting the wish and having it granted anew, while being fully aware of the situation that caused the wish to relapse to this state.</p>
<h2 id="an-actual-true-story-a-letter-i-wrote-to-a-friend-once">An Actual True Story… A Letter I Wrote to a Friend Once</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/anr73/who_is_the_most_beautiful_person_you_ever_met/c0iiniv/">“Who is the most beautiful person you ever met?”</a></p>
<p>Beauty is such a mysterious thing. Let me tell you about the time I met the love of my life.</p>
<p>It was right after I took the bar exam, and thousands of tired law students were wandering like zombies- unsure what to do with their lives now that their marathon of studying was finally over.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is an <strong>actual</strong> true story. No twist endings. No funny business. I just wanted to share something honest with you all. I promise. I wrote it to a good friend of mine on the trip back home. I’ve left it in the present tense:</p>
<hr />
<p>Sometimes you find yourself wandering the empty streets of Buffalo, soaked to the bone carrying 100 pounds of luggage. For me, today was one of those times.</p>
<p>Let me tell you about Buffalo: If you’re on the right street at the right time, the sidewalks are packed, and in the streets vendors are selling fresh fruit under tents, and some of them are making caramel popcorn. Everything is alive and vibrant. But then you walk two blocks away in any direction and everything is closed, and there isn’t a soul to be seen.</p>
<p>You think that maybe if you keep going for a block or two, you’ll find life again, but you don’t. Eventually you turn back to the busy part of town, except somehow, inexplicably, it’s gone. You’re right back where you started, but the street vendors and the crowds are gone, and the 3,000 bar examinees that earlier swarmed the streets with you are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>So, you’re in Buffalo, you’ve just stepped out of the bar exam, and you discover that somehow it has started raining heavily. You completely forgot to pack any rain gear, and you’re holding 150 pounds of luggage. BUT, you’ve just finished taking the bar, so you figure you’ll go outside and just enjoy the feeling of warm summer rain on your skin, like Tim Robbins’ character in The Shawshank Redemption.</p>
<p>You actually feel pretty good for the first few blocks as you walk to where you think the bus station ought to be. But soon you find yourself in the ghost town that is most of Buffalo. You realize you’ve walked a half mile in the wrong direction, and the 200 pounds of luggage you’re carrying is starting to severely cripple the muscles in your neck. The warm summer rain doesn’t feel very warm anymore, and your shoes are starting to make squishing sounds with every step.</p>
<p>You walk a mile to the Buffalo Bus Station, which, other than Rush Limbaugh’s mirror, is the most depressing place you could possibly be. Everyone in the bus station is either incredibly poor, completely miserable, or a convicted felon on the lam.</p>
<p>A smelly person asks you for money. You shake your head, the smelly person says “God bless you anyway,” and you don’t even feel guilty, because that is the hundred-thousandth person that has asked you for spare change today, and you’ve started to hate poor people for being poor. Wait, that’s just the bar exam talking.</p>
<p>You spot the most beautiful girl you’ve ever seen, and she is wandering around the station in a continuous circuit. She is keeping her head up, but being careful not to make eye-contact with anyone, including you, which is infuriating. Because you know that if only your eyes would meet, she would see past your thinning hair, scruffy unkempt beard, blood-shot, baggy eyes, and fall instantly in love with you. But instead she just keeps orbiting around and around the train station. She isn’t staying still long enough for any of the panhandlers to ask her for money. She’s obviously a pro.</p>
<p>Then she makes a fatal error, she stops to look at the bus schedule. This is all the time you need to walk up to her and ask if she can tell you where on your ticket it says at which gate you should be. She’s very polite because you’re not asking her for money. You decide not to tell her that you’re in love with her just yet. But you are. You make a hasty retreat while she still thinks you’re charming, if somewhat clueless. You go wait in line for your bus. You spend the next 15 minutes chatting up an attractive Asian bar examinee before you notice that the love of your life has gotten in line a ways behind you. You decide to ignore her, because that’s the rock star thing to do.</p>
<p>You take your 400 pounds of luggage and get on the bus, and you want to sit next to the attractive Asian bar examinee, because if you have to share a seat with someone, it’s wise to choose your partner in advance. She wants to have two seats all to herself. You can tell she isn’t blowing you off, she just wants to be able to lie down. The poor girl is obviously a rookie. She chooses the seat over the rear wheels. This is the worst seat on the bus. You had planned to sit across from her, but you decide that she’s not cute enough to suffer 9 hours of violent jarring as you become a human shock absorber. You move forward, and pick out a primo seat near the middle of the bus.</p>
<p>As you are moving in to your good seat, the love of your life is squeezing by. She notices you, and because you didn’t stick around and hit on her in the bus station, and because you ignored her like a rock star, she asks if she can sit with you. Jackpot.</p>
<p>It is at this very moment, with the bus becoming increasingly crowded, that the attractive Asian bar examinee realizes that she is not going to be getting two seats to herself, and that in fact, she will probably end up being wedge against the side of the bus as an extremely obese man with a glandular problem squeezes into the seat next to her. She shouts up to you, “hey did you want to sit here?” Sorry baby, too late now. “No, thanks,” you say, “I’ve already got some charming company.”</p>
<p>You sit next to the love of your life, and the bus ride begins. She’s in the mood to talk, and she turns out to be really fascinating. She’s got a masters degree in city planning or something and she’s telling you about how she wrote a project about how to prepare some Podunk town for a terrorist attack on its railway system. She also talks about how she used to be a climatologist, and other interesting brainy things. She knows trivia about Orson Wells, and H.G. Wells. She likes all the same obscure hilarious 1970s British comedy shows that you do. You love her so much.</p>
<p>You have been chatting happily for two hours, but something isn’t right. It is dark on the train, and you notice that she has been obscuring her left hand for some time. She is elusive when asked about who she’s going home to. You suspect an engagement ring.</p>
<p>She takes a couple of phone calls, and ambiguously tells the caller she’s going to be home in a bit. She is not using her girlfriend voice, she hasn’t said “sweetie” or anything, and she signs off without an “I love you”. It could be a parent, a friend or a roommate, but you want to see the ring finger to be sure.</p>
<p>After 15 minutes more of a smashing conversation, you see a very nondescript but sort of costume-jewelry-ish ring on her ring finger. If this is a wedding or engagement ring, he is one cheap bastard. You think back to the train station, and how she was such a pro at not being bothered. Maybe it’s a decoy ring? You ask her who she’s going home to, “Roommate, boyfriend, husband?”</p>
<p>“Husband” she says.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nice,” you say. That’s really all you can say when God has just kicked you in the balls.</p>
<p>You don’t want to be an asshole, so you politely carry on the conversation, as if you’re just super-duper thrilled to have a nice new friend. Eventually we get to her station stop. She exits, stage left.</p>
<p>When she is gone you decide to test out the bus wifi system (pretty cool! Internet on the bus!). You are feeling pretty bitter and lonely, so you decide to go all-in and do what you promised yourself you wouldn’t ever do again, which is to google your ex-girlfriend in the hope that you will find a news article about how her fiancée died in a horrible and prolonged accident. The article quotes her as saying “I’ll never be happy again, unless I can find a suitable replacement, like my ex-boyfriend, [<em>flossdaily</em>], who I really should have married some time ago.”</p>
<p>Oddly, no such article exists.</p>
<p>Instead, you find out that she has finally set up a facebook page. You think that you ought to friend her, because maybe if she broke up with her fiancée, this would be a nice passive way of finding out. Worse case scenario, she’s still getting married, so it’s not like you’ll be any MORE heartbroken.</p>
<p>Mercifully her profile picture is terrible. Has she put on weight?</p>
<p>You decide not to friend her just yet, but you do send her a brief message. You’ve got to see what’s going on in that profile. You are a masochistic idiot.</p>
<p>It’s 2:20 in the morning. You haven’t had a sleep longer than 4 hours in about a week. You aren’t even tired. You have about 9 more hours of travel ahead of you before you can crawl into your bed and hide under the covers.</p>
<p>Fuck Buffalo.</p>
<h2 id="psa-why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-road-is-not-an-anti-joke.-its-a-regular-joke.">PSA: “Why did the chicken cross the road?” is NOT an anti-joke. It’s a regular joke.</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/5mjscy/i_just_realized_the_joke_why_did_the_chicken/">‘I just realized the joke “Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side” was a suicide reference.’</a></p>
<p>It’s not a suicide reference. And it’s <strong>not an anti-joke</strong>. It’s a regular joke… And it’s actually hilarious.</p>
<p>“Why did the chicken cross the road?” is a question that makes you think we’re talking about the grander motives of the chicken. What is she up to? Where is she going?</p>
<p>“To get to the other side” is a classic joke twist, because it casts the setup in a new light. It gives us a technical, pragmatic answer. Yes, literally speaking that is why ALL roads are crossed. It was never about the chicken’s motives at all.</p>
<p>So that’s why it’s a regular joke: we were led down a “garden path” and we got our satisfying twist. It’s making light of the ambiguities of language.</p>
<p>But why is it a <strong>hilarious</strong> joke?</p>
<p>Because we’re talking about a chicken… arguably one of the stupidest animals in the world. They aren’t exactly known for strategic thinking, if you see what I’m saying.</p>
<p>So the fact that you just wasted a moment wondering about its grand long-term plans on the far side of the road, only to discover that it–<em>of course</em>–has no grand motivation, is doubly funny.</p>
<p>It’s just a stupid chicken. We should have known all along.</p>

<p>One day, Batman decides to kill Superman.</p>
<p>Batman prepares for a confrontation by forging a bat suit made out of Kryptonite, and designing a gun that can fire kryptonite bullets.</p>
<p>While his preparations are underway, Batman decides to use his intelligence and wit to befriend Superman- preying on Superman’s good will and naively positive world view.</p>
<p>After weeks of preparation, and a small fortune spent acquiring the world’s supply of kryptonite, Batman is finally ready. He dons the kryptonite bat suit, and holsters his kryptonite shooting gun.</p>
<p>Batman is smart, so rather than attempting to lure Superman out under false pretenses, Batman bides his time and waits for appropriate circumstances to present themselves. Perhaps a league of supervillains will require collaboration, the Justice League will have a reunion party.</p>
<p>One day, not long after, an opportunity presents itself. Superman is invited to Gotham City to a ribbon cutting ceremony at a new strip mall.</p>
<p>Batman shows up, and approaches Superman from across the crowded plaza.</p>
<p>Superman, with his super hearing, notices that Batman’s heart rate is elevated. He looks around to see what has Batman so distressed, and quickly realizes that Batman’s cold stare is focused firmly on him.</p>
<p>Little did Batman know, however, that mild mannered reporter Clark Kent had, just a week prior, been assigned to to cover a news story about the international commodities market- specifically on the strange financial signals indicating that Bruce Wayne, industry titan was cornering the market on kryptonite.</p>
<p>Superman notices the greenish tint to Batman’s new suit, and immediately puts the pieces together in his mind.</p>
<p>Recognizing the danger, Superman rockets into the atmosphere with his super speed.</p>
<p>He then flies around the Earth faster than the speed of light, thus propelling himself backwards through time… he keeps up this tremendous speed until he finds himself several decades in the past.</p>
<p>Satisfied he has arrived at the correct date, Superman swoops back down to Earth. It is night in Gotham City.</p>
<p>Superman spots an affluent couple and their young son on the streets as a vagrant attempts to mug them.</p>
<p>The would-be mugger fires his weapon, only to find that his bullets are stopped in mid-flight by Superman. The man of steel quickly disarms the robber and incapacitates him by bending a nearby lamppost around him.</p>
<p>The couple Superman just saved are none other than Bruce Wayne’s parents. Superman gives them a friendly wave, then flies back into the atmosphere to reverse his trip through time.</p>
<p>Back in present day, Superman returns to Gotham- a city newly rife with crime and corruption. A city that has never heard of a “Batman”.</p>
<p>You see, by preventing the traumatic death of Bruce Wayne’s parents, Superman has removed Bruce’s motivation for ever becoming a vigilante crime-fighter.</p>
<p>In fact, Bruce Wayne has no alter-ego at all, he merely works at his family’s company, living in the shadow of his father, the unnoticed playboy son of a a truly powerful man.</p>
<p>On certain cold, rainy days, Bruce looks sadly out of his office window and wonders if perhaps he was meant for greater things.</p>
<p>The cold streets of Gotham answer with nothing but the sound of rain on glass.</p>
<h2 id="horrible-sleep-deprivation-case-from-my-undergrad-psych-days">Horrible Sleep-Deprivation Case From My Undergrad Psych Days</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rjjy7/if_there_were_surgery_that_made_it_so_you_never/c46c83s/">“If there were surgery that made it so you never had to sleep, would you have it?”</a></p>
<p>This surgery was actually accomplished at a research/teaching hospital in Can Tho, Vietnam(?) about 15 years ago. One of my first assignments in undergrad was to write a paper about it… it’s been a while, but here’s the gist of it:</p>
<p>They had a patient who had chronic night terrors- several times every night, the guy would wake up screaming from the worst nightmares- and this had gone on for nearly decade. If I recall, they tried putting him on every possible combinations of medications (at least, every kind available in Vietnam at the time) to help him sleep, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Years of sleep deprivation, and the stress associated with the condition finally took their toll, and the guy tried to kill himself… not very effectively, though, because he ends up surviving, and becomes a full-time resident of some god-awful psych hospital.</p>
<p>His night terrors continue, and he becomes kind of famous in the hospital because his screams at night are “disrupting” the other patients, apparently enough that he starts getting special attention.</p>
<p>At some point, he gets the attention of a brain surgeon, who suggests doing this completely irresponsible surgery where they want to cauterize part of his hypothalamus, and basically turn off his desire/need for sleep. Apparently, they had gotten this idea from a war veteran who had a shrapnel injury to that same part of his brain and likewise, no longer required sleep.</p>
<p>So, they end up doing this crazy surgery, except it doesn’t work- mostly because it’s just an insanely stupid and dangerous plan to begin with, but also because this is in the days before they have fMRIs to help with this sort of thing, so they’re basically going in blind when they do the surgery.</p>
<p>So, they go in, and they burn out a sesame-seed sized part of this guy’s brain, and for a couple weeks it actually looks like everything went as planned: the guy no longer desires sleep, so he just never goes to bed. Night terrors are gone, everything is peachy.</p>
<p>Except that it isn’t.</p>
<p>After a couple weeks, the hospital staff reports that they guy is behaving strangely. Among his symptoms: he hears voices that aren’t there, he’s gone color blind, and he won’t eat any kind of food with a rough texture- so basically I think he was living off of broth, jello, ice cream. Strangest of all… the guy doesn’t seem to care that all this weird stuff is happening- he basically doesn’t demonstrate any emotional response to any of it.</p>
<p>And this is all very weird, because the symptoms he’s displaying don’t seem to be consistent with brain damage to the hypothalamus- hearing voices, for example would be something you’d expect with damage to the auditory cortex, and lack of emotion would be something more likely associated with frontal lobe damage (?).</p>
<p>Anyway, the thinking was that he was experiencing some sort of chemical imbalance from the lack of sleep, and that his symptoms were largely due to some weird sleep-deprivation induced hallucinations.</p>
<p>They start dosing him with all sort of meds which are supposed to simulate the chemicals produced during sleep…. at this point I’ve totally forgotten what they were- but I think it might have been serotonin?</p>
<p>Whatever they did, it didn’t work. The guy just gets weirder and starts displaying some pretty crazy paranoia, directed at the hospital staff. He thinks they’re trying to torture or kill him. BUT, simultaneously, his emotional affect is super low, so he doesn’t seem all that bothered by the fact that he thinks they’re trying to harm him.</p>
<p>There is a video clip floating around of an interview with him <strong>[edit: i just spent 10 minutes looking for it, can’t find it… sorry]</strong>, where he’s talking to an off-camera interviewer… totally creepy- the dialog is basically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interviewer: Do you feel safe here?</p>
<p>Patient: Yes.</p>
<p>Interviewer: But a moment ago you said that you thought we were poisoning you.</p>
<p>Patient: Yes.</p>
<p>Interviewer: We are not trying to poison you.</p>
<p>Patient: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p>Interviewer: But you feel safe here?</p>
<p>Patient: Yes.</p>
<p>Interviewer: How can you feel safe if you feel your life is in danger?</p>
<p>Patient: I don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…so anyway, the guy walks around being a weirdo, and an emotionless zombie for a while. But then things turn pretty dark for him.</p>
<p>He starts having these shrieking fits out of the blue, and random times during the day. Turns out he’s having visual hallucinations now, and seeing the images that used to only terrify him in his dreams. The only one I distinctly remember is that he had a recurring hallucination about a dog or a wolf that would come out from behind doorways and attack him.</p>
<p>He reported that the attacks felt real, and in fact, stated that he could actually FEEL the teeth of the dog penetrating his skin.</p>
<p>He was also terrified during the hallucinations, but as soon as they were over, he went back to being pretty much without affect. So basically the guy spent his life feeling no emotion except for the occasional pure terror of a nightmare come to life.</p>
<p>Eventually, his hallucinations got more and more frequent. First they were happening every couple of days, then a few times a day.</p>
<p>The doctors tried to back-peddle and wanted to induce sleep in the patient, hoping that they could find a way to confine his night terrors to regular sleeping times again- but the damage they had done to his brain not only killed the desire to sleep, but also his <em>ability</em> to sleep.</p>
<p>They could pump him full of tranquilizers, and it would slow his heart rate and breathing, but he never lost consciousness.</p>
<p>His condition deteriorated over the next few months to the point where he was almost constantly hallucinating about this wolf attacking him. He would scream for hours on end, and reported being in tremendous pain. And horror-of-horrors, because his pain was all in his head, they couldn’t find any narcotics to treat it.</p>
<p>After just 4 months, the patient reported that his hallucinations were CONSTANT- as in, they never let up for even a moment. He reported that day and night, without pause, he could feel a dog’s fangs deep in his ankle, and he could feel the animal tearing his flesh and pulling his leg, just like I’m pulling yours.</p>

<h2 id="my-craziest-drug-experience">My Craziest Drug Experience</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/anda7/hey_reddit_whats_the_craziest_drug_experience_you/c0igkeu/">“Hey reddit, what’s the craziest drug experience you ever had?”</a></p>
<p>Oh god… okay. You want craziness- I’ll give you craziness! Actually though, the craziness is less about what the drugs did and more about all the shit that lead up to me taking them.</p>
<p>As you can tell by the amount of time I spend online, I don’t get out much. It’s been that way for years… much worse when I’m single. I’ve got people that I invite over every now and then, but no one I would consider a real friend.</p>
<p>Anyways, one night something told me I should get out of place and do something, so I went with some folks down to a nightclub. It was an okay sceneloud music, but not so much that I couldn’t talk to people. The people I was with sort of ditched me, or a ditched them- whatever.</p>
<p>I met I girl there, and we hit it off right away (it turns out we knew someone in common). You know how sometimes you meet someone and the conversation just gets really deep and intense? This was one of those times. So I’m thinking: GAME ON.</p>
<p>I don’t know what it was that I said wrong, but I fucked it up, as usual. I woke up alone, as usual.</p>
<p>BUT, the next day, the mutual acquaintance that we had gives me a call. And though I think we may have chatted online, we definitely didn’t have that call-upand-chitchat relationship going on. So I’m thinking that this girl probably told him to give me a call or something? I don’t really know how women’s minds work with these sort of things… so I’m thinking: GAME back ON!</p>
<p>So this mutual (friend now?) suggests that we hang out. I agree. And low and behold, whose there to meet me? Hot girl from the club (yay!). At this point I know I’m gonna gonna get laid.</p>
<p>So, everything sounds great so far, right? FUCKING WRONG. Because I’m not just hanging out with her, I’m hanging out with her weird friends now too. And it turns shitty real fucking fast. Her freak of a friend pulls out a gun.</p>
<p>Not being comfortable around guns, I did what any sane person would do, and I tried leave. SMART MOVE. But then Hot Girl calms the whole situation down, and so I stay. DUMB MOVE.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, I’m going to inject a little little public service announcement: If you are hanging out with strangers who pull guns on you, don’t be surprised later when drugs get involved.</strong></p>
<p>So we wind up at this shit-hole apartment which I’m sure they were squatting in. The place has got like two sticks of furniture in it, it’s dark, and looks like nobody has actually lived there for years. WORST PART: NO BEER.</p>
<p>I’m trying to figure out what the scene here is, right. Because there’s no TV,no beer, no food, no signs of an actual party… and like 5 or so people just hanging out (including the guy who called me, and freak who pulled the gun on me).</p>
<p>It suddenly dawns on me that I’m standing in exactly the sort of place you would expect to find people shooting up heroine and OD’ing on the floor. And I’m thinking: this is fucking ridiculous… I’ve got a good a job, never really done anything illegal (except online of course! FUCK THE RIAA!), I don’t even smoke- and I’m standing in what has got to be a freakin’ crack den or something.</p>
<p>Okay, if you know me at all at this point, you can probably tell that I’m not the sort of person that just bows to peer pressure, but you have to understand- I was in a room full of people staring at me- ONE OF WHICH HAD PULLED OUT A FUCKING GUN EARLIER.</p>
<p>Anyways, so out come the drugs- big surprise, right? Except I’m actually kind of relieved because these guys weren’t shooting up, and they weren’t doing lines of coke (for some reason I’m totally phobic of that too). It’s just pills. <strong>NO LABEL-And they won’t even tell me what they are.</strong></p>
<p>But everyone in the room has done it before, and they’re still fine- so I figure I’m probably better off doing drugs than pissing off people WHO ARE CARRYING GUNS.</p>
<p>So that’s really the exciting part of the story, because when it comes to the actual pills, they didn’t do much. It probably helps that, although they offered me a couple, I only took one. It didn’t do much except wake me up from the giant robotmade prison where they were using my body heat to power their city.</p>

<p>UNITED STATES HOMELAND SECURITY – SAFETY MANUAL – EQTL DOC #298171729</p>
<p>RECOMMENDED EARTHQUAKE PROCEDURES SUBCHAPTER 7 SPECIFIC REC.: LAVATORY PROCEDURES</p>
<p>The SPECIAL PANEL of CIVIL ENGINEERS (SPCE) convened a two month investigation for the purposes of publishing recommended safety procedures for army personal caught in lavatories and latrines during significant earthquake emergencies. The panel was later instructed to modify these recommendations for distribution to the public. These recommendations are contained here within.</p>
<p>SAFETY PROCEDURES FOR CIVILIANS IN BATHROOM AND PRIVATE RESTROOMS:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is recommended that all civilians keep an Earthquake Emergency Kit where it will be easily accessible in the event of a significant quake. This kit should contain flashlights, batteries, first aid and medical supplies, as well as 2 gallons of potable water per person and non-perishable foodstuffs (recommended 4000 calories per person). Detailed recommendations are found in subsection 3 of the previous chapter.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>[… note from poster: there’s a lot of procedural stuff for if your in a shower and whatnot- I’ve cut it out because it’s pretty boring. Here’s what they wrote about being caught on a toilet:]</strong></p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li>Recommended Procedure when seated on a commode:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>The recommendations for females urinating in a commode is identical to the procedures for standing males outlined in 17(a)(1).</li>
<li>For persons defecating in commode at time of initial quake impact, the following guidelines should be followed if possible:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>Brace yourself against a wall, railing or any stable surface.</li>
<li>Secure any nearby objects that may cause be hazardous, such as glass picture frames, liquor bottles and porcelain sculptures.</li>
<li>Regular sanitary procedures such as using cleansing wipes, sanitary paper wipes, or the three sea shells, should temporarily suspended in order to move to secure location.</li>
<li>Flushing the toilet is highly recommended at the first detection of a tremor.</li>
<li>Trousers or other garments should be secured only as necessary to prevent tripping or slippage.</li>
<li>Exit the stall or bathroom, and proceed to secure locations as suggested in paragraph 2(b)(2) of this subchapter.</li>
<li>If you are sharing your shelter location with others, it is recommended that you keep a polite distance without compromising your safety.</li>
<li>If odors become noticeable, follow the instructions in paragraph 14(a)(17) of subchapter 4 “Awkward Small Talk Proceedure”.</li>
<li>When initial tremors are over, if the building appears to be structurally sound, return to the bathroom and tend to sanitary concerns as quickly as possible, then return to the locations recommended in Chapter 5(a)(1) “Post-Earthquake Safety Zones”.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>[… note from poster: the document goes on and covers some other bathroom situations like if a quake hits when brushing your teeth or washing your dog, but it’s not really germane to this discussion.]</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-weirdest-story-of-my-life">The Weirdest Story of My Life</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/amfsb/the_weirdest_story_from_my_life_what_do_you_think/c0ic1f9/">“The weirdest story from my life. What do you think?”</a></p>
<p>This is the weirdest story of my life:</p>
<p>In late December, 1998 , I was in my sophomore year at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. School had been out for a while for intersession break. The campus was dead. I don’t think anyone was supposed to be in the dorms at that point, but no one told us we couldn’t be- so, having no place else to go, I stayed.</p>
<p>I was sitting in my dorm room, in the late afternoon. It was already starting to get dark out. My dad had just called me, so we were shooting the shit. He and mom were out enjoying tropical paradise on Maui (Hawaii’s most gorgeous island, apparently). They were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary over thereotherwise I suppose I would have been hanging out with them at our home near Boston.</p>
<p>I said goodbye to my dad after about 5 minutes of pleasant chit-chat, and I walked over to put the phone in the receiver (I didn’t start carrying a cell phone on me for another couple years or so). As I set the phone down in its cradle, something caught my eye through the cracks in the venetian blinds.</p>
<p>I separated the slats of the blinds, somehow cutting my finger in the process. I peered out into the darkening quad and saw an what looked like a wiggling train of fireflies.</p>
<p>I turned off my dorm room light, and looked outside again. Now, without the glare on my windows, I could see clearly a procession of what looked like three dozen people, all walking single file, and all carrying lit candles.</p>
<p>My first thought was that this must be a vigil or something for a student that died. It had the look and feel of a memorial. But then on second glance I decided that those weren’t students at all. They were walking slowly and they didn’t have the gait of young people. They were skinny, terribly skinny. Each of them wore a black robe with hoods pulled up over their heads, and each robe flowed all the way to the ground, trailing several feet behind them. The sun was down behind the hills, and I was having trouble making out any details at all beyond the black robes and flickering candles.</p>
<p>It this point I was really getting curious. It was also at this point that I noticed that my finger had been sliced open on the blinds, and was oozing a surprising amount of blood.</p>
<p>I stepped out of my room- once again sensing just how empty and eerie the hallways were. Strange how the mind plays tricks on us- I could have sworn I saw a shadow going around the corner just as I step into the hall. I stood still, but heard no footsteps. I shook my head and laughed at my paranoia.</p>
<p>Being careful not to let the door close behind me, I walked to the communal restroom and rinsed my finger under the tap. I soaped up my hands and felt the sting of it on the cut. I grabbed a paper towel, but thought that it might not be the most sanitary thing to put on a wound, so I went back into my room, looking for a bandage.</p>
<p>I saw that I had some sort of ace bandage that looked like it was made for wrapping up sprained joints- but I figured it would do the job. I hastily wrapped my finger and did my best to tie off the bandage. For a relatively small wound, the bandage was comically big.</p>
<p>With my minor emergency out of the way, I pondered what to do with myself. If I was smart, I could get a jump on the calculus textbook before next semester- but the idea held no appeal. I decided to have a little adventure instead. I would go and catch up to the candle-bearers and figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>Grabbing a stylish-but-much-too-light-for-the-weather coat from where I had casually flung it on my bed, I rushed out of my dorm room. Hearing the lock snap in place behind me, my blood went cold for a moment. I’d been so careful before not to let the latch shut! Was I locked out? I quickly patted the outside of my coat, trying to see if I could feel the keys in my pocket. Ahhh… there, left coat pocket. I didn’t even have reach in to to confirm, I heard the keys jingle as I patted them.</p>
<p>I clomped quickly down the stairs and out the dorm’s front door. 3 paces out, dashed back, wedging a rock into the door frame. If my student ID badge wasn’t going to let me in over the holidays, I certainly didn’t want to find out tonight. It was bitter cold.</p>
<p>About an inch of clean snow had accumulated on the ground, and though I saw no more of the robed parade, I easily found their footprints- or rather the long snakelike pattern that was carved out by their dragging robes.</p>
<p>I jogged along the snaky path until it disappeared into the woods. I paused.</p>
<p>The woods were dark, abut the snow on the ground, and the moonlight above made it possible to see quite a bit better than I’d been expecting. I stepped cautiously into the woods, and after about 10 steps, got spooked and turned around. I walked towards the break in the trees, when behind me in the woods I heard a the distinctive sound of dozens of hand clapping once in unison- and there was a chanted word spoken simultaneously, but I couldn’t make it out. The held the word, in a song-like fashion. Then another group clap, then silence.</p>
<p>Realizing how close I was, now, to finding the answer to this mystery, I trudged back into the woods. As I followed the path over a small mound of earth, I saw the unmistakable glow of a bonfire not too far ahead. I approached slowly.</p>
<p>When I got near the fire, I saw the robed figures- large men, all of them… and fat… all of them fat… they didn’t make sense, I was sure when I’d seen them earlier they’d been noticeably thin!</p>
<p>I stayed out of sight, not wanting to interrupt the … ritual- yes, they were performing some sort of a ritual! They were standing, all of them, in a circle around the bonfire. The were all linking their hands with one another- NO… NO… There hands were bound together with leather straps! In unison, the would approach the fire, and raise their hands, the step back and lower their hands, all as one- like… like some sort of pulsating sea organism.</p>
<p>After they had repeated this cycle for a few minutes they all stopped- I wondered how they all knew to stop at once- I hadn’t heard or seen anything to organize them to act in concert. They shook their arms until the leather straps that bound them all together slid to the snowy forest floor. Then they all clapped in unisonjust as they had before.</p>
<p>The chanted the word again. I still couldn’t make it out, it sounded like- well… no it couldn’t be… but it sounded like they were all saying “SSSSsssaaaaaaaaa” (satan?) but they were sort of chanting/singing it in an odd and unpleasant chorus. But what I saw next, chilled me to bones…</p>
<p>As they chanted, their bodies vibrated… slowly at firsts, then violently…. and they were…. swelling…. just becoming bigger and bigger… no not taller… just fatter. Their black robes stretch and their disgusting distended bellies contorted and pushed against the fabric. It was almost as if something was growing inside themand trying get out.</p>
<p>I inhaled sharply at the shock of it… and became acutely aware of what a stupid thing that was to do… I didn’t know what was going on here, but I knew I didn’t want to be seen by these… people??</p>
<p>They stopped their chanting and vibrating, and re-bound their arms to one another. The processes was starting again. The started swaying in and out from the fireexcept now I could see that the fire was growing higher and higher each time they moved inwards.</p>
<p>I wanted to run then, but as they moved in and out from the fire, they were so quiet… they would surely hear me, and I didn’t want to think about what that meant. I felt something warm and wet on my arm… blood from my cut finger was saturating the bandage and flowing down my arm. Somehow I knew it was because of the ritual.</p>
<p>They stopped their pulsating dance, and let the leather straps fall once more. The clapped, and again chanted their word…. “Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaa……” they started again to vibrate…. “..aaaaaaaaa…” … and grow…. “..aaaaaaaaaa…” … and now at last, their robes could no longer stand the strain… the seams ripped, exposing bloody red underneath… “…aaaaaaa…” … the chanting chorus grew and reverberated- now all the robes were bursting off the engorged bellies …. "“…aaaaaaaaAAAAAAA …”</p>
<p>And then I finally understood… the robes, now only tattered ribbons of fabric sank to the ground. Underneath, they all stood. Black boots. Red pants. Black belts. White gloves. Red coats with white trim. They finished their chant “…AAAAANTA!” They clapped in unison. Dozens of Santas, chubby and red. My jaw dropped.</p>
<p>The all looked at each other- the transformation complete. They let out deep bellylaughs… the “Ho! Ho! ho!” we’ve all come to love.</p>
<p>Then, one of them raised his arms in a sharp gesture. They all stopped laughing, and stood perfectly still.</p>
<p>The Santa that had stopped it all threw his head back and started sniffing the air deeply. He kept this up for about 30 seconds before he stopped and said, “blood.”</p>
<p>He turned and looked directly at me- his eyes were as cold as death.</p>
<p>“Blood,” they all said in unison. They just said it… coldly… calmly.</p>
<p>They all turned to face me now. And I ran. I ran like I’ve never run in my life. I didn’t know where I was going except away… away from the fire, away from the echoing laughter I heard in the distance…</p>

<p>Thank you! Thank you! Thank you ladies and gentlemen! Thank you!</p>
<p>Well, that was a tremendous welcome. You know, I’ve been campaigning all over this great nation of ours, but I do believe it is here in this very town that I’ve received the warmest and most wonderful welcome.</p>
<p>Mayor Smith, Councilman Peters, and my fellow Citizens, it is truly an honor and a privilege to come here and speak to you today.</p>
<p>Now, times are tough. And tough times mean that you all have a lot of tough questions for people like me, and for my distinguished opponent from Tennessee. I’m ready to answer those tough questions, but I’m going to ask you to hold them until after I’ve outlined my plan for a new and better American Society.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that our economy has seen better days. I know that fine folks like you are out there struggling. Some of you can’t find work, and some of you are only scraping by on half the salary you used to make.</p>
<p>Now, I could throw a lot of hooey at you, and the same tired mumbo-jumbo that you’ve been hearing from Washington Insiders for years. But I’m not going to do that. I’m going to tell you the truth.</p>
<p>And the truth is, that things are bad right now, and they’re going to stay bad, unless we start injecting some common sense back into Washington.</p>
<p>Other politicians, and especially my Tennessee opponent, are fond of telling you that the economic recovery bill is working. I don’t know about you, but I don’t think that giving your hard earned money to failing banks is the answer!</p>
<p>No, ladies and gentleman, we need to address our financial crisis at it’s source: the government-created mutant squirrel-people that are eating our crops, and impregnating our women.</p>
<p>Too long, have the fat-cats in Washington ignored this rampant problem that you know all too well in your tiny battle-weary town. Every night, after you lock the iron bars on your windows and sit huddled inside with your shotguns at the ready, you watch the nightly news, and you see what I see: story after story of squirrelperson massacres.</p>
<p>Now, my opponent doesn’t want to talk about this issue. And do you know why? It’s because the Republicans don’t have a solution to the mutant squirrel-person menace. Oh sure, they talk about a poison-pellet system- but that’s just another name for the same failed strategy they’ve been using for years. Who do they think they’re fooling? Certainly not the mutant squirrel-people, and certainly not you!</p>
<p>Folks, I’ve traveled all around this beautiful nation, and I’ve given this speech more times than I can count. I’ve seen the scarred and pale faces of men, who have tried in vain to defend their crops, and I’ve seen the swollen bellies of the good women of this country who have been seduced and bedded by the mutant squirrelpeople. And I HAVE HAD ENOUGH.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m here asking for your vote! We need to get to Washington and pass this piece of legislation right here. In my left hand is the very bill that I intend to push through the tired old bureaucracy, and sign within my first 100 days as your President.</p>
<p>This bill, which I keep with me in my pocket- is step 1 of a three step plan. When you and I push this bill through the Congress, it will finally give the United States the authority it needs to force Canada to lift its acorn embargo once and for all. Too long have our Canadian neighbors watched us suffer while they have turned the once warm hand of friendship into the cold shoulder of indifference.</p>
<p>No more! Canada will stop hording their strategic acorn reserves, while hungry mutant squirrel-people continue to destroy our corn fields, and occasionally really hold up the line at McDonalds.</p>
<p>Stage 2 of my plan has received a great deal of media attention lately. You’ve heard a lot a lies, and a lot of half-truths- because my opponent doesn’t want this to be a debate about facts. But I’m going to talk to you about facts anyway.</p>
<p>Fact: Squirrel-people are afraid cats.</p>
<p>Fact: Genetically altered cats, twice the size, with metal claws and acid-spit are indisputably scarier than regular cats.</p>
<p>Fact: Genetic engineers can safely produce these cats, while maintaining their docile nature with regard to non-squirrel people.</p>
<p>Fact: Unlike some nasty campaign ads you may have seen, there is no indication that our genetically altered super cats will develop human-like consciousness and a thirst for baby-blood.</p>
<p>My fellow citizens, when Republicans worked to ban genetic modification projects after the mutant squirrel-people escaped, they were closing the barn door after the horse had bolted and impregnated our women.</p>
<p>It is time to reopen that door of science, and use what we’ve learned from this tragedy to help solve the problem.</p>
<p>If we get those mutant cats on the streets, we have estimates from the Department of Agriculture that in as little as 2 months, we could implement stage 3 of my plan: Turning around our food crisis by consuming the meat of the captured mutant squirrel-people.</p>
<p>Now I know there are a lot of other issues out there like healthcare, same-sex marriage rights, and small-business tax cuts, but I’d like to open the floor at this time for anyone who has questions about the squirrel-people problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>tl;dr: Fact: Generically altered cats, twice the size, with metal claws and acid-spit are indisputably scarier than regular cats.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience-with-the-internet">My Experience With the Internet</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/am00f/how_old_were_you_when_you_discovered_the_internet/c0i9zim/">“How old were you when you discovered the ‘Internet’, what year was it and what do you remember of your first experience?”</a></p>
<p>I remember it all too well…</p>
<p>I was a paperboy at the time. I didn’t take my job too seriously- so usually I would just throw the newspapers haphazardly towards the residences, and keep on going on my bike. Sometimes the papers would wind up getting snagged high up in a hedge- sometimes they would slide under a parked car. I didn’t really care.</p>
<p>But there was one day I’ll never forget. It was an early fall morning as a I peddled down a very nice street in a posh neighborhood. There was a man waiting by his mailbox at the end of his driveway down the street. I tossed my newspapers as I always do- sort of aiming for the center of the driveways, but not really taking care to be precise.</p>
<p>As I made my way slowly down the street, I noticed that the man just kept standing there at the end of his driveway… staring at me as I got closer.</p>
<p>I was beginning to get a little bit wary at this point, because I suddenly got the feeling that he was waiting for me.</p>
<p>It turns out I was right. When I peddled near to his house, he waved me over. “Come here, boy!” he said. It was very authoritative. I remembered because no one ever really called me ‘boy’ like that. It was off-putting.</p>
<p>“I want to show you something,” he said, and beckoned me to follow him up to his door. I thought he was going to show me where he wanted me to put his newspapers. I felt a little embarrassed that I had tossed them so lazily.</p>
<p>But to my surprise, he opened the door to his house, and motioned for me to follow him inside. I was a little bit hesitant, and I guess if I had been thinking clearly I wouldn’t have done it, but I was young, and didn’t really know any better, so I followed him.</p>
<p>He left the door open behind me, and I realized he wasn’t going to ask me to come in any further than his small entry hallway. He pointed to the pictures on the wall. I recognized some of them- George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln… but there were all sorts of people from different points in history.</p>
<p>“Do you know who these men are?” he asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. “They’re the President’s aren’t they?”</p>
<p>He nodded patiently. “Some of them are Presidents, and some of them aren’t. This one here is Thomas Edison, the man who invented the light bulb. And this one Mark Twain, the great American author.”</p>
<p>I nodded dumbly.</p>
<p>“Do you know what they all had in common?” he asked.</p>
<p>“They were are really smart?” I said.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, they were all people of fortitude. Do you know what that word means?”</p>
<p>I shook my head, no.</p>
<p>“It means they possessed strength of will,” he said. “It means that if they do a job, they do it right, and they do it with integrity.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>He continued, “I want you to ask yourself if you’re doing your job with integrity.”</p>
<p>I could feel my face turn red. I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Listen,” he said, “from now on, when you’re on your bike delivering papers, I want you to think about all the people who depend on you to do that, and I want you to ask if yourself if you could be doing a better job for them.”</p>
<p>My mind was racing, trying to think where I could have thrown this man’s newspaper that he would go all the trouble to give me such a lecture. Did I throw it on his roof yesterday or something?</p>
<p>Before I could respond, he sent me back on my way. I handed him a paper, and sheepishly continued on my route.</p>
<p>But every house I visited from then on, I would walk right up to the door and leave the paper on the steps.</p>
<p>The next day, before I went on my route, I wrote dozens and dozens of little notesthey all said “have a nice day!”- and I stapled them onto the papers before I went out. This time I did my whole route by walking up to peoples’ doorsteps. I kept this up for several months- each day with a different note. My route took me about twice as long to get through, but it didn’t matter. I was determined to have fortitude- whatever that meant.</p>
<p>One day, peddling down the street, I saw the same man, standing by his mailbox. By the time I got to his driveway he was already walking inside, motioning for me to follow him. So I set my bike down and went inside.</p>
<p>This time he walked past the entry way, into the main part of the house… I followed him with a bit of trepidation. I wonder if he was going to lecture me again- though I couldn’t imagine why. I’d left his paper right at his doorstep everyday!</p>
<p>When I got to his dining room, I saw an elaborate meal on the table. A feast, really. He told me to sit down and have a plateful of whatever I wanted. I took some of the delicious food, and as I chomped away, he told me that he was very impressed with the job I’d done, and at how much integrity it showed.</p>
<p>He told me that he worked in the government, and that in a few years when I was old enough, he would like to give me a job working in his office. I thought it was a nice offer, but I didn’t even ask him what he did. Kids can be a little slow that way. He gave me an envelope on which was written “Fortitude Tip”. I could tell there was cash inside. I thanked him warmly and headed out the door.</p>
<p>On the way out of the house I noticed the door to his den was open- inside I saw a whole mess of metal and wires on the desk. A weird humming emanated from the room.</p>
<p>“What’s in there?” I asked.</p>
<p>His expression changed- I can’t exactly describe it. But he closed the door to the den and told me not to worry about it. He ushered me outside quickly but gently.</p>
<p>I didn’t see him again for some time- but I kept writing little notes to hand out with my newspapers. Sometimes it would be the same thing to everyone, but sometimes I would personalize it. ‘Nice roses this year’ or ’your car is the envy of the neighborhood!".</p>
<p>For the man, though, I would make an extra effort to write personal notes. I ran out of things to say, so I would try to find quotes from books. Mostly stuff about fortitude and integrity.</p>
<p>One day as I was placing the newspaper on the man’s doorstep I heard crashing noise from inside, and what sounded like a grunt or a moan. I listened for a moment more and didn’t hear anything. I knocked on the door. I rang the bell.</p>
<p>No one came to the door. I was worried something bad had happened inside.</p>
<p>Now, the thing about delivering papers to people’s doorsteps day in and day out, is that you start to notice things about their homes. You notice when they paint, you notice when they get a new planting. …And sometimes you notice when their spare key is sticking out just a little bit from underneath a potted plant.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see the key now, but I had seen a glint of it a few months earlier. I reached under the planter and found the cool metal with my fingertips.</p>
<p>I quickly stuck the key in the door, but before turning it, knocked louder and shouted. There was no answer.</p>
<p>I turned the key and ran into the house.</p>
<p>I heard some quiet groaning coming from the den. I rushed over.</p>
<p>When I opened the door to the den, I was shocked. From wall to wall there was electronic equipment of all shapes and kind. Things were buzzing and beeping, and whirling.</p>
<p>In the center of the room were three enormous boxes, labeled ‘1’,‘2’, and ‘3’… the boxes were all connected to each other with huge trunks of cable. The boxes had dozens of blinking lights- and noisy fans.</p>
<p>In the far corner of the room, I saw an overturned workbench, and underneath the man was pinned- surrounded by electronic components I’d never seen or imagined.</p>
<p>I went over to help the man. I was a small kid, but strong enough to help him lift the workbench off of himself. As he pried himself from underneath it, I could see that the table leg was made of wood, and it looked like it had become disconnected from the bench-top and given out.</p>
<p>I helped the man to his feet, and walked with him into the living room. I set him down in a chair and fetched some ice from the freezer.</p>
<p>As he sat there icing his ribs and his knee, I asked him about the giant blinking boxes in the other room. “What… what is all that?” I said.</p>
<p>He paused for a minute- deciding whether he was ready to share his secret. And then…</p>
<p>“That, my boy, is the Internet,” he said. “I invented it.”</p>
<p>I asked him what it did, and how it worked. He explained to me that he had written it all down in a notebook, but it would take too long to explain how it worked.</p>
<p>When he was feeling a little better we walked back to the den. On one wall he turned on three small television screens- labeled ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’ just like the boxes. He explained that the boxes were computers. I’d heard the term before- but I’d never seen a computer so small before! I was amazed.</p>
<p>Then he showed me how he could make numbers from one computer go to the other computers with just a few button presses. He told me that was sending the numbers through the phone system! He pointed to a bunch of rotary phones on the wall which I hadn’t noticed before.</p>
<p>He let me punch some numbers on one computer, and I watched them appear on another. He explained that it didn’t matter how far apart the computers were, that the numbers would be transfered lightening quick.</p>
<p>He explained that the internet would revolutionize society. I didn’t understand what that meant, but I knew for sure that this device was like magic.</p>
<p>He showed me his notebook, and his drawings and schematics. It was all so overwhelming. So I killed him and took all his stuff. Years later I secret sold the technology through a dummy corporation. When I ran for President in 2000, I told everyone that I invented it. But they all laughed at me…</p>
<h2 id="an-awkward-confession">An Awkward Confession</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/alae8/warning_potentially_disturbing_question_sexy/c0i6kuh/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“Warning: Potentially disturbing question! Sexy relatives?”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a hot mom and/or sister (of you’re a woman or gay dude, a hot dad and/or brothers)? I’m not saying just cute, but… omg so hot everyone turns around!!</p>
<p>If so, is it hard for you not to see them as fap material? Or it’s no problem at all? Does it affect who you choose as a sex partner? (I.e., if your mom/sis is a tall-hot Asian woman, do you avoid tall-hot Asian women?)*</p>
<p>Background: I’ve been lucky enough not to have any relatives that look anywhere hot (to my taste). My mom is disgusting-looking (though I love her), and my sister is cute, but again not my type (I prefer and fap to blue-eyed blondes). I’ve heard so many stories about guys/girls being disturbed and shuddering at the thought of having sex with their parents. I’ve never had that problem, that is, it’s difficult for me to picture it, for the reasons stated above.</p>
<p>But anyhow, it made me wonder about others… I’ve always thought that having a smoking hot sister or mother must be horrible, but that might not be the case. Thoughts?</p>
<p>*No, I’m not Asian.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Before you read this: Please don’t judge me… I’m just sharing my story because people asked…</p>
<p>Wow… okay, I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to tell anyone about this, but it’s late and I’m sleep deprived so i guess I’ll just write it now and regret it in the morning :/</p>
<p>First of all, - just for some background: My mom died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn’t about her. I guess that’s fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad’s family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.</p>
<p>Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.</p>
<p>I don’t want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn’t make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad’s family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).</p>
<p>Sooo… I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.</p>
<p>My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it’s pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her… and it wasn’t a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn’t like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn’t sisterly.</p>
<p>After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister’s friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He’s a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I’m not saying that I’m proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.</p>
<p>My friend and my sister never hooked up I don’t think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.</p>
<p>Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart… and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I’ve ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. <em>Sigh</em>.</p>
<p>A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can’t say I was surprised.</p>
<p>But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party… my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.</p>
<h2 id="story-time-the-bear-pit">Story Time: The Bear Pit</h2>
<p>Originally hosted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120329045857/http://wagist.com/2011/joshua-vogel/story-time-the-bear-pit">wagist</a>.</p>
<p>So, I was standing there trying to figure out how to kill a black bear with a pocket knife.</p>
<p>The game is usually fair, and in a combat round you tend to be given weapons equal to the task at hand. The knife was part of a multi-tool, and though the blade was sharp, it was also short, and the odd shape of it felt uncomfortable in my hand.</p>
<p>I suppose I should have felt lucky to be holding the knife at all. When this round began, I thought there was nothing. The ground was a coarse yellow sand, and only half an inch of the stainless steel contraption was unburied. If the sun hadn’t glinted off the metal just so, I never would have seen it. Of course, even the position of the sun was precisely controlled, so in all likelihood the reflection was designed to find my eyes.</p>
<p>The bear made a noise that sounded somewhere between a roar and a sneeze. It didn’t seem particularly aggressive to me, but, then, I didn’t have much experience with bears.</p>
<p>I took a moment to glance down and find out what they had me in. The fabric had felt light and breezy, so I wasn’t surprised to see that it was a fine white linen. It seemed like it might have been a toga, but I didn’t want to take my eyes off the bear long enough to figure out the mechanics of the outfit. I could see that I had a snug leather belt around my waist, though, and the fabric draped skirt-like well above the ankles, so I didn’t have to worry about tripping over it.</p>
<p>I still had canvas sneakers on, which was nice. Sandals would have been better suited to the outfit, but generally the game let me keep whatever footwear I brought with me from the previous level. I’d acquired the canvas sneakers in an earlier round, when in a moment of desperation I’d knocked a teenage kid off his bicycle and bludgeoned him with a rock. It was horribly traumatic for both of us, but probably more so for me, since I was the only one that actually existed.</p>
<p>That was one of the only rules I knew for sure: no matter how lifelike the characters seemed, they weren’t real.</p>
<p>They had done little work on the scenery, this time. I seemed to be in a tiny oval arena, but they hadn’t bothered to create any seating. Outside the low walls of the sandy pit was just the dull white color of empty space, which seamlessly blended into a blue, sunny sky.</p>
<p>The bear seemed to be losing interest in me, if it had had any to begin with. It backed away slowly and started sniffing the wall at the perimeter of the sand pit. From the way the wall caught the sun, it seemed to be made of some sort of painted sheet metal or plastic, and something about it reminded me of a hockey rink.</p>
<p>I slowly moved backwards to the opposite side of the sand pit until I could feel the wall at my back. It was smooth and warm to the touch. I let my fingers drag along the surface while I walked a few feet, feeling for a seam. There was none. Without a seam, there was no panel to ply loose, and no easy exit- unless I found a hidden door. But I had a feeling I wasn’t meant to leave this space.</p>
<p>I was finally far enough away from the bear to examine the pocket knife. It was the sort that unfolded into a pair of pliers. I could see a can opener attachment and small Philips head screwdriver. Nestled in the handle next to the knife blade was a file that looked like it might work on metal.</p>
<p>I wondered which of the tools I would be expected to use. If this was puzzle challenge instead of a combat round, then any or all of the pocket knife extensions could come in to play. The game always gave you the tool you needed for the job. At least, that’s the way it had worked so far. But it was always getting more difficult- physically, mentally… and in other ways, too.</p>
<p>The first round of the game had been just a hammer and a nail.</p>
<p>The second round had been a hammer and a baby.</p>
<p>The bear made a loud snort on the far side of the arena, and stood on its hind legs. It sniffed the air for a moment then returned to all fours. I eyed it careful for a minute while it wandered about slowly. It seemed almost bored. Bored was better than angry.</p>
<p>The wall was only about four feet high. I estimated that I could probably climb over it without too much trouble, if the game would allow it. But the game did not usually allow for such things. There were an inexhaustible number of ways it could stop me. The wall might have a top edge that was razor sharp, or perhaps there was some sort of invisible force field above it. That would be a lazy solution to keep me in place, but it wouldn’t be the first time.</p>
<p>I considered taking a running leap to vault out of the arena, but it occurred to me that such a move might trigger the bear to charge, whether out of its natural instincts, or some hardwired condition of the game.</p>
<p>Escaping the arena was futile anyway. Even if I could get out, there was likely just an infinite ocean of sand on the outside. I might wander around until I died of dehydration, if they let me. Most likely they’d just let me stumble about for a while and then put the bear pit right in front of me. This would go on for weeks or months until I finally fought the thing. That’s assuming I was supposed to be fighting it. I still couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p>The bear sauntered around the pit, less concerned about keeping his distance than I was. I circled the pit and kept as far from the animal as possible. Gripping the knife hard, I felt the awkward metal hilt dig into my flesh. The rough sand made for unsure footing, and the muscles in my legs were fatiguing quickly.</p>
<p>If I was supposed to kill the bear, I figured I should do it now, before my legs got too tired, and before I had the chance to think about it too much. Still, the mechanics of the attack had to be worked out. I figured my best shot was to lodge the small blade in the bear’s throat- it was the only vulnerable spot I could think of. But just now, it was not looking particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>I took a step forward, and even though the bear remained relatively placid, I found that my feet did not want to carry me any closer. What if I did lodge the knife in the bear’s throat? Would that be enough? I imagined that even if I got a good strike in, the bear could still tear me apart before it bled out. Then I tried hard to stop imagining that.</p>
<p>I noticed that I had started shaking. I hadn’t realized how afraid I was. As an abstract concept, bears had never scared me. Even seeing one up close in a zoo hadn’t even aroused the faintest stirrings of fear. But now, mere feet away from the thing, I felt raw terror creeping in.</p>
<p>It had been the same with the wolves in an early level. But I’d had a samurai sword then, and some sort of plate armor. Now I felt naked, and the blade I was holding might as well have been made of plastic for all the good I thought it would do.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and silently repeated my mantra: “It isn’t real. It isn’t real. It isn’t real.”</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and took another step forward. It sure felt real.</p>
<p>The bear wasn’t looking at me, even though I was only two large strides away from it. It occurred to me that perhaps they’d given me a blind bear, or maybe just an extraordinarily stupid one. That would have made it fair, right? The game is usually fair.</p>
<p>I took another step. My canvas shoes sank strangely in the sand. This was not good footing for a fight.</p>
<p>Before I could think about anything, I stepped again, closing the distance between me and the bear. Still, it didn’t even acknowledge me.</p>
<p>I was close enough to touch it now. The funky smell of it, and the odd noise of its heavy breathing were all that I could think about.</p>
<p>Its head was down, and now that I was here, I couldn’t figure out the mechanics of actually stabbing it in the throat. I just didn’t have the leverage or the angle to get a good thrust there.</p>
<p>The fur on the bear’s head was a bit thin, and through it I could see the dark skin covering its skull. If the bear remained still and calm, I would be able to land a spectacular downward thrust right there in the crown of its head. If the blade punctured the skull, it would almost certainly mean instant death for the bear.</p>
<p>The game had taught me that when I needed to kill, it was best not to over think things. I had my target. I had my weapon. I had my plan of attack. Best to make quick work of it.</p>
<p>I rotated the knife so the blade pointed downward, then I raised it above my head with both hands.</p>
<p>I took a slow, deep breath, and said my silent prayer. “It isn’t real. It isn’t real. It isn’t real.”</p>
<p>I plunged the knife down with the full force of my weight, and instantly I realized I had made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>The tip of the blade found its mark, but rather than crashing through the bone, it slid downward, following the curvature of the bear’s skull, opening a deep cut. The wound would not be fatal, at least not instantly so. But that was not the most pressing problem.</p>
<p>The real horror of my situation became clear moments later when I felt the excruciating sting on the crown of my own head, and felt every nerve scream as a gash opened all the way down to the flesh behind my ear. It was a mirror to the cut I’d given the bear, though the pain was so intense that it took me several seconds to recognize it.</p>
<p>The bear had made an odd sort of yelp when my blade struck. It sounded more surprised than hurt. The animal had stumbled away in fear and confusion, which had been somewhat of a relief until my own wound had appeared. Now my pain was so severe that it was difficult to think at all. But I did have wits enough to command my legs to take me as far from the bear as possible.</p>
<p>My hand went up to my head. There was too much blood. The wound was so raw and painful that touching it hardly made a difference. I felt skin torn loose from the bone beneath, warm matted hair, and blood, and blood, and blood.</p>
<p>I felt light-headed, and wondered if I was going to pass out- but surely the game would not allow such a thing. Death was a possibility. Though what death meant in the game was a mystery to me. Perhaps it would mean waking to the real world, whatever that was.</p>
<p>My hands were shaking so much that I wondered if it was simply adrenaline, or if it was a symptom of some kind of brain damage from the head wound.</p>
<p>“It isn’t real. It isn’t real. It isn’t real.”</p>
<p>I noticed with a mixture of relief and surprise that I was still holding the knife in my hand. My first thought was to charge the bear and stab it until it died. My pain had made me fearless. I needed this round to be over. In the next level I would be healed. The game always gave you a fresh start.</p>
<p>I stumbled towards the bear, but my legs were wobbly and gave out beneath me after a few strides. I jumped to my feet again, throwing sand everywhere. My movements were spastic and sluggish. My body was failing. I would not have much time.</p>
<p>I stumbled closer to the bear and wondered if it was in as much pain as I was. I took a moment to be thankful that it was still passive and calm in spite of everything. In fact, even now it seemed not to see me.</p>
<p>I felt dizzy, and as I moved again I lost my balance, falling face first in the sand. I landed strangely and twisted my arm. I felt it bend, then snap. I expected a shot of pain to course through me, but by some miracle there was none. Perhaps the wound on my head had exhausted my ability to feel any other pain, for the torrent of agony that streamed from my scalp was unrelenting.</p>
<p>As I was getting to my knees, a peculiar thing happened. One of bear’s front paws gave out from under the beast, and it fell into the sand roaring and whimpering. A mirror of my own broken arm… but where I held felt no pain, the bear clearly did.</p>
<p>I gazed down at my own arm to look at the break and marvel at the lack of pain, but upon examination, I could see no injury at all. Where I had felt it twist and crack, the arm now looked completely healthy, and was not even the slightest bit tender to the touch.</p>
<p>The rules of this round were starting to become clear. I stood up slowly and made my way over to where the bear making a sad and disturbing sound- somewhat like a howl. The bear did not acknowledge me, and somehow I was confident that he would not, or could not become aware of my presence.</p>
<p>I did not want to press my luck, though, so I only got close enough to confirm the theory that was forming in my foggy mind. I looked at the bear’s head where I had so violently lacerated it. The fur there was wet with blood, but the gash itself was gone.</p>
<p>Suspicions confirmed, I knew what I had to do next. Looking down, I saw that the knife was gone. For a moment, I thought it was a cruel twist in the game, but then I realized that I’d simply dropped it when I had stumbled.</p>
<p>In moments, I had fished the blade out of the sand, and was holding it loosely in my hand. I was fairly certain about what I needed to do, but I thought I better perform one last test, just to be sure. Also, I wanted to find out if it was going to hurt.</p>
<p>I held the blade against the palm of my hand, and I was about to give it a healthy slice, but at the last moment I realized that I wouldn’t be able to be certain if it worked or not. I moved to knife to the bridge of my nose, and, staring at the bear, I cut.</p>
<p>The cut wasn’t too deep, but I should have been in agony… well, more agony than the head gash was accounting for. Instead I felt nothing, even as the blood gushed from the wound. But few seconds later the bear bellowed pathetically as a mirror cut appeared on its face, as if carved out by some invisible knife.</p>
<p>I moved my hand up to my nose. There was blood, wet and sticky, but the cut I had just made was gone. That was it then. The results were in.</p>
<p>I took a moment to consider the poor bear, confused and in pain. I was likewise suffering, but knowing that my torment (this torment, anyway) was almost at an end gave me a sense of tranquility. What was the kindest way to end the bear? The neck or the heart?</p>
<p>I considered the knife for a long while and decided that I probably couldn’t thrust it into my breast with any great ease. Was there bone or merely cartilage over the heart? If I ever knew the finer points of anatomy, the game wasn’t letting me remember them- or perhaps it was just the pain from my head that was dulling my mind.</p>
<p>The neck would have to do, I supposed. I raised the blade slowly, trying not to think about the insanity of what I was doing. As the steel touched my throat, I felt warmth of the metal, and its hardness. But even as its tip punctured my skin, I felt no pain.</p>
<p>I made quick work of it- cutting deeply and opening the arteries in my throat. The sheer volume of blood was shocking, but even as it found its way into my lungs, and caused me to choke, I felt no pain except from the cut on my head- the cut I had intended for the bear.</p>
<p>Some few seconds later I felt the flesh of my neck mend itself, while simultaneously the bear began to roar and squeal and gurgle. I did not enjoy watching it thrash about and die. I regretted that I had not thought of a quicker and less painful way to dispose of it.</p>
<p>It was still twitching a making gargling noises a minute later, and I was wishing it dead now for selfish reasons. The pain from my head wound was unbearable, and I needed this round to be over. I was contemplating stabbing myself in the heart to speed the process, when finally the animal was still.</p>
<p>There was as sudden and absolute silence as all the ambient noise from the level suddenly ceased. When the game was resetting between levels, you couldn’t even hear the blood flowing through your ears.</p>
<p>The world dissolved away, as it always did, leaving me in an ocean of white, while the game conjured up some new horror for me.</p>
<p>“Fourty-Four” said a voice from no place in particular. There was always a voice announcing the beginning of a new round. I was trying to figure out if it was the same voice every time, but no matter how much I focused, I couldn’t actually discern any characteristics of the voice at all. I couldn’t even tell you if it was male or female. It was a soundless voice, like when you’re thinking words in your own head.</p>
<p>I was waiting for the next level to solidify around me, but many long seconds went by with no sign of scenery. I was standing in an empty, infinite white space.</p>
<p>I wondered if there was a glitch in the game. A moment of panic seized me. What if no one was monitoring the game? I could be stuck in this limbo for years- centuries even! My pulse was raising, and I started running aimlessly in a misguided attempt to jar the game back into a working state.</p>
<p>I only made it three steps before I slammed into something solid. Pain shot through my face, which had taken a good share of the impact, but after a moment, the mild throbbing injury reminded me that my bleeding head gash was now a thing of the past.</p>
<p>I ran a trembling hand through my hair and felt not even a trace of dried blood. I looked down to see if my clothes were still soaked in blood, and was momentarily surprised when I realized that I was no longer wearing the white linen toga.</p>
<p>My outfit was a simple white t-shirt and a pair of green shorts. My grey canvas sneakers were still with me, and they didn’t even have a trace of sand on them. The new outfit and the solid object in front of me renewed my faith that the game was still functioning properly.</p>
<p>I reached an unsure hand in front of me to feel what I’d run into. It was solid and flat. As I ran my hand along its surface, I suddenly became aware that it was a solid white wall that started at the floor and went up higher than I could tell.</p>
<p>I followed the wall for several paces until it intersected a second wall at a right angle. I traced the second wall in a similar fashion until I hit a third, and then a forth.</p>
<p>A room. I was trapped in a featureless white room… or a deep, featureless white pit depending on whether there was any kind of ceiling over my head.</p>
<p>The walls were a perfect white color, and the game had conjured no defined light source. There was no hint of shadow, or glare or anything to give a clue about depth or shape or texture. Even where the walls met, there was no visual queue at all.</p>
<p>The absence of any other living presence made me think that this was a puzzle round. I hated puzzle rounds- they could last for weeks- even months.</p>
<p>The worst part of a puzzle round was figuring out what the puzzle actually was. And this time the game had really started me with nothing. How does one answer when there is no question? I leaned against a wall and sank to the floor sullenly.</p>
<p>As I sat, there was noise beneath me. Startled, I scooted aside. There was nothing where I had been except the featureless white floor. Then I realized that the sound had come from me, or rather from my pocket as it had hit the floor.</p>
<p>I reached a hand into the deep pocket of my shorts and was surprised to find my hand grasping the multi-tool from the previous level. The blade had been folded down, and there was no blood or sand to be seen, but I was certain that it was the knife I had just used to slit my own throat.</p>
<p>This was an interesting turn of events. The game did not often let me keep anything but footwear from one round to the next. I wondered if there was a reason. There wasn’t always a reason for things. That’s how the game kept you on your toes.</p>
<p>“Fourty-four,” I said aloud. I wondered how many more levels there were to go, and whether the game would outlast my sanity.</p>

<h2 id="music-box">Music Box</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aq8q3/does_listening_to_certain_music_bring_back_a/c0iufzl/">“Does listening to certain music bring back a feeling from the past?”</a></p>
<p>When I was 7 years old, my grandmother gave my younger sister a music box. I remember I was a little jealous at the time, but I understood that music boxes were sort of girly presents, so I never said anything about it. I might have been more jealous if I had known that this was no ordinary trinket.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night I heard my sister playing the music box. The weird thing was, I would hear her <em>talking</em> to it. Now, that was strange- but my sister was weird little kid, you know? And because she would only talk to it at night with her door closed and locked, I never really made fun of her about it- mostly on account that it only happened as I was falling asleep, and didn’t remember to tease her in the morning.</p>
<p>During the day she would wind the thing obsessively, but she would only lift the lid to play the music at night. It was a haunting tune. I don’t think I’ve heard anything else quite like it. It reminds me of something Mozart might have written if he were deranged. I guess that won’t make sense to most of you.</p>
<p>My sister went missing when she was 14. It was a horrible ordeal for my family. I might write about it someday, but I don’t have it in me right now. The short version is that on one pleasant day in May of ’96, she simply never came home. If you were old enough and you lived in Massachusetts you might even remember the news reports about it. Pretty White Girl goes missing- always a big deal. But the publicity didn’t help.</p>
<p>We assumed she was abducted, but we never got a single decent lead. After 3 years of waiting and praying (and with me off to college), my parents split up. Their relationship just couldn’t handle the strain.</p>
<p>When they split they decided to sell the house. Without any kids at home, it just didn’t make sense for either of them to keep it. It was over my Christmas break that they asked me to help clear out my Sister’s room.</p>
<p>It was tough to do. We hadn’t really gone in there since she went missing. My parents would pick up each individual object, reminisce about it and have a cry. This went on for hours. Eventually, I had to be the grown up. I just started dumping things into cardboard boxes without any fanfare. My parents looked hurt, but I think my way was healthier.</p>
<p>We moved my sisters things into storage, along with a whole bunch of furniture from the house that neither of my parents had room for just yet. The big stuff was loaded onto a truck, but the small stuff came with me in my car.</p>
<p>After we unloaded everything into the storage place, and padlocked our memories behind the sliding garage door, my mom and I parted ways with my dad. I spent the next few weeks of vacation locked in my room playing computer games, and counting the days until I could be back in school with my friends.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I arrived back at my dorm that I noticed the shoebox. It was in the very back of my trunk behind my laundry bag. I had to open it before I realized it was some left over junk from my sister’s room.</p>
<p>Most of the stuff inside was kid junk, but I also found my grandmothers music box. I was feeling sentimental, I guess, because I threw it in with my stuff and brought it to my room.</p>
<p>I had arrived a couple days before classes started because I was volunteering to help some of the mid-year transfer students to get oriented. The unfortunate consequence was that my dorm was pretty much empty, and none of my friends were on campus.</p>
<p>I plopped down on the bunk bed and turned on the television. I watched some shows I can’t remember now, and then, because I was feeling melancholy, I picked up the music box and brought it with me to the bunk.</p>
<p>I was about to turn the key to wind it, but when I turned it over the notes rang out. I shut it, then turned off the television and opened it again.</p>
<p>The notes were ringing out that old, eerie tune, and as they did so, I shut my eyes. That’s when I heard a voice.</p>
<p>My eyes snapped open and I slammed the box shut again. I heard nothing. I waited a moment and opened the box again. The tune rang out, and I heard the voice again. It was the voice of a little girl. It seemed to be coming from the box somehow.</p>
<p><em>“Hello?”</em> it said. <em>“Hello?”</em></p>
<p>“Hi.” I said, feeling ridiculous. “Who is this?”</p>
<p><em>“I’m Jenna,”</em> she said. I slammed the box shut again and dropped it on my bed. I stood up so fast that I cracked my head on the upper bunk. Stars filled my vision and I cursed loudly.</p>
<p>I sat on the floor for a moment, cradling my head and rocking, until the pain dissipated enough for me to think clearly. I opened up my tiny dorm fridge and pulled out the only thing I could find in my freezer: a small contraband container of whiskey. I wrapped it in a paper towel and pressed it against my skull.</p>
<p>I moved back to the bed and stared at the box. The box had said ‘Jenna’. Jenna was my sister’s name.</p>
<p>I opened it again, and said, “Hello? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>The little girl voice said, <em>“Yes! Can you hear me?”</em></p>
<p>“I can,” I said. “Jenna, what’s your last name?”</p>
<p><em>“Price,”</em> she said. Jenna Price. That was my sister’s name.</p>
<p>“Hi Jenna,” I said. “Where are you?”</p>
<p><em>“I’m in my room,”</em> she replied.</p>
<p>“I’m in my room too,” I said. “How are you?”</p>
<p><em>“I’m good!”</em> she said, <em>“My grandma just gave this to me! It’s so neat!”</em></p>
<p>I said, “It is neat, Jenna. –Jenna do you know what year it is?”</p>
<p><em>“Of course I do, silly!”</em> she said. <em>“It’s 1987!”</em></p>
<p>I was staring at the box, head throbbing, hands shaking. This wasn’t happening. It couldn’t possibly be.</p>
<p>I thought back to all the nights when I heard my sister talking to the strange little box. Could she have been talking to me? No. I must have lost my mind.</p>
<p>Before I could say anything else she said, <em>“Mom says I have to go to bed. I’m going to go to bed now.”</em></p>
<p>“Wait!” I cried. But there was no reply.</p>
<hr />
<p>I spent the night, and into the morning winding the box and listening to it- listening for any sign of my sister. There was none. I went to work groggy the next day and helped the new kids figure out how to get their ID badges and other mundane things.</p>
<p>When my shift was over in the afternoon I bolted back to my room. I was at the music box again, opening and shutting the lid like some sort of mental patient with the world’s worst case of OCD.</p>
<p>I was almost hypnotized by the rhythm open the box, letting the music play for a cycle, shutting the box, winding the box, opening thing box, etc… It was around 8:30 at night when I heard the voice again.</p>
<p><em>“Hello? Are you there?”</em> she asked.</p>
<p>It startled me and got my heart racing, “Yes Jenna! Yes I’m here!”</p>
<p><em>“That’s neat,”</em> she said. <em>“What’s your name?”</em></p>
<p>“I’m… Ben,” I lied. Why did I lie? I wasn’t sure- It had seemed like the prudent thing to do.</p>
<p><em>“Hi Ben,”</em> she said.</p>
<p>“Jenna,” I said, “Can you go get your mommy or your daddy and show them how I’m talking on the box? It’s very important.”</p>
<p><em>“Okay!”</em> she said brightly. Then she was gone.</p>
<p>I waited and waited, but she did not return that night.</p>
<hr />
<p>The following night was almost exactly the same. We said our hellos. I told her to bring the box out to her parents while I was still talking.</p>
<p>She agreed, and I talked really loudly, for a few minutes so that they might hear me. But then realized that whatever connection we had had been severed again.</p>
<hr />
<p>On night three, I told Jenna to make sure she had a paper and pencil ready for next time.</p>
<p>She took this as an invitation to go off and grab them right then. She disappeared and didn’t come back.</p>
<hr />
<p>On day four my roommate came back. He wanted to go out and party with me. I lied and told him I was very sick. He fought with me for a bit, but eventually gave me some privacy.</p>
<p>When Jenna came back that evening I told her to write this message on a piece of paper: I will be abducted on May 10, 1996. Then I had her write down my social security number. She couldn’t spell, so I talked her through the message one letter at a time.</p>
<p>When she was done I had her read the document back to me, as best she could. I told her to take the note to my parents and to make sure both of them read it. I told her to tell them it wasn’t a joke. She promised she would.</p>
<hr />
<p>On day five I convinced my roommate I was still sick, though he didn’t believe me. He gave me some space anyway, but Jenna didn’t come back.</p>
<hr />
<p>On day six I took the box out to my car and sat with it all night while my roommate used the room to make out with some girl he had just met.</p>
<p>The haunting tune from the box was in my brain day and night now.</p>
<p>Jenna never came.</p>
<hr />
<p>On day seven I camped out in my car again. Same reason. Same result- no Jenna.</p>
<hr />
<p>On day eight, I got my room back. The roommate decided to spend some time with his new lady friend.</p>
<p>It was 9:00 at night when I heard, <em>“Hello? Ben? Are you there?!”</em></p>
<p>“Yes! I’m here!” I shouted. “Jenna, what happened when you showed the note to your mommy and daddy?”</p>
<p>There was a hesitation, <em>“They got really angry. They didn’t believe me when I told them about you.”</em></p>
<p>“Did they know what the number was at the end of the note?” I asked.</p>
<p><em>“I don’t know,”</em> she said.</p>
<p>It was so frustrating. She was so young. Did she even remember the number at the end of the note?</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure if I could use Jenna to change the past. I decided to test it.</p>
<p>“Jenna,” I said, “do you think you could make a big scratch mark on the music box? Do you think you could do that for me?”</p>
<p>I was going to ask her to scratch the lid of the box, but as I turned the box around, there was already a scratch mark there. That wouldn’t do.</p>
<p>I decided I’d ask her to scratch the bottom instead, but checking under there, I found a scratch mark too. I couldn’t see the back of the box; I was starting to understand something. If I had it in my mind to ask Jenna to scratch a part of the box, a scratch mark would be there before I checked. It would have been on the box for years.</p>
<p>“Jenna,” I said. “I want you to make a scratch in the bottom of the box and one in the top of the box. Can you do that please? Make them nice big scratches.”</p>
<p><em>“I don’t want too”</em> she said, <em>“I’ll ruin it.”</em></p>
<p>“Jenna, it’s very, very important,” I said. “Please.”</p>
<p>She waited a moment then said, <em>“okay.”</em></p>
<p>I heard a scraping noise, and the connection was gone.</p>
<p>I looked at the back of the box. No scratch mark. It didn’t prove anything.</p>
<p>I tried to wrap my mind around it. I could ask Jenna to alter her future, but I would change with it. She made two scratch marks on the box because I saw two scratch marks and asked her to make them.</p>
<p>I finally understood. I could never save Jenna. If I set in motion a course of action which saved her from being abducted, the box would not fall into my hands. If the box never fell into my hands, I couldn’t send her the messages that would save her from her fate.</p>
<p>I lay for hours before I was taken by a fitful sleep.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next day I teased it out in my mind. There <em>was</em> a solution. I knew there was. It was just beyond my grasp.</p>
<p>Those scratches on the boxes were there because I saw them, but <em>also</em> because I asked for them to be there. I was part of the cycle. There <em>must</em> be a way.</p>
<p>I was having lunch with my roommate. He wanted to have a heart to heart. I did my best to explain that I wasn’t trying to avoid him. I wouldn’t tell him about the box, so I made up a story about having a long distance phone relationship with a girl I met over winter vacation. He seemed to buy it.</p>
<p>The rest of my social life had fallen apart. I was spending every evening by myself waiting to talk to a music box. I wondered if I had gone crazy. I almost certainly had.</p>
<p>Time travel isn’t real. Crazy <em>is</em>. Crazy is <em>common</em> actually, and time-travelling messages were impossible. I didn’t feel well. I excused myself, and retreated to my dorm room.</p>
<hr />
<p>The roadblock I hit in my mind was this: If I was going to stop Jenna from being abducted, I needed her to get my younger self involved in such a way that he grew up <em>with</em> a sister, yet also got a hold of the music box, with enough motivation to have the kind of conversations I was having with Jenna over the past week.</p>
<p>It was not an impossible task, but the catch was, I had to communicate this all at one time- through a 5-year-old. And if I was successful? Time would fold around me, and none of my life since the abduction would ever have happened.</p>
<p>That couldn’t be right. It just couldn’t. I looked at the scratches on the music box. Those scratches had <strong>always</strong> been there. Jenna had <strong>always</strong> been abducted.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a thought hit you so hard that you actually gasped? I hadn’t either until that very moment.</p>
<p>All at once I understood. And then I had the seeds of a plan. It grew in my mind. So many things to think about- so many things to prepare.</p>
<p>I ran- no- sprinted to the library. I talked to the librarians about what I needed: newspapers- old newspapers from my hometown and state. They didn’t have what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I ran back to my room, grabbed the music box and my keys. I said goodbye to my roommate and dashed to my car. In ten minutes I was on the highway, speeding home.</p>
<p>I played the music box along the way home. Halfway through my drive Jenna spoke to me.</p>
<p>“Jenna!” I screamed. “Jenna, you have to talk to me tomorrow night, and you need to have a pen and some paper. Practice your letters because I need you to be a good writer tomorrow. Can you do that for me?”</p>
<p>She said, <em>“yes.”</em> I was so excited. This was going to work.</p>
<p>Jenna felt chatty and this time I had no problem talking to her about the silly little details of her happy little life. We talked for twenty minutes. At the end I reminded her about the paper and the pen and tomorrow night.</p>
<hr />
<p>When my hometown library opened at 9:00 in the morning, the librarian found me on waiting on the steps, legs bouncing nervously with manic elation. She let me in and showed me to microfiche newspaper archives.</p>
<p>I found the papers I wanted quickly, May 10, 1996 and the following two weeks. When I read the human interest story that made the front page on May 15, 1996, I began to weep. My plan was going to work… because it already had.</p>
<p>I read the article carefully, and copied down the details I would need. I looked through the newspaper on May 11, copied the final piece of the puzzle onto some scrap paper.</p>
<p>I dashed upstairs and showed the librarian my scrap of paper. I pointed to an address and said, “Can you tell me how to get <em>here</em>?”</p>
<p>She looked at my careful handwriting over her tiny glasses, and then gave me some rather simple directions. I thanked her quickly and was on my way before she was even done saying a casual “you’re welcome.”</p>
<p>In minutes I pulled up to the house.</p>
<p>I rang the bell. A young woman arrived at the door. Someone I was not expecting. “Excuse me,” I said. “I’m looking for the Goldbergs- Harold and Shelly Goldberg. They used to live here?”</p>
<p>The young woman was polite, “Oh yes. We bought this house from them a few years ago.”</p>
<p>I said, “I <em>have</em> to find them. It’s extremely urgent.”</p>
<p>The young woman said that she might be able to dig up a phone number and a forwarding address from her records. Then she said, “Oh, you know, if you go right next door and talk to the Clarks I’m sure they know. They were very close, and I bet they still keep in touch.”</p>
<p>I said a quick thank you and ran over to the house she had indicated. As I ran she yelled, “Come back if they don’t have it!”</p>
<p>I waved at her over my shoulder and in seconds was ringing the Clark’s bell.</p>
<p>After the better part of a minute, a man about my father’s age came to the door. “Mr. Clark?” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, “what is this regarding?”</p>
<p>“I need to find your old neighbors, the Goldbergs. It’s extremely urgent. I was told you may know where they are.”</p>
<p>“Well they moved away,” he said, “Years ago. They moved to Jackson Hole, Wyoming after…”</p>
<p>His voice trailed off. He didn’t want compromise his friends’ privacy. I filled in the gap, “…after they won the lottery twice in same week.”</p>
<p>Mr. Clark nodded at me suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Do you have their phone number? I must speak to them. It’s very important.” I said.</p>
<p>He stared at me for a moment, sizing me up, then said, “Alright. Wait right here.”</p>
<p>He closed the door in my face and returned a minute later, holding a piece of paper with a number on it. I barely had time to thank him before I was back in my car, driving back to town, and to buy a phone card.</p>
<hr />
<p>The phone rang twice before a pleasant female voice said, “Hello?”</p>
<p>My heart was pounding as I said, “Yes, hi. I’m looking for Mrs. Goldberg.”</p>
<p>“Speaking,” she said.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Goldberg,” I said, through my dry throat, “My name is Peter Price. I’m looking for my sister.”</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end. At first I wasn’t sure if she’d heard me. But then she uttered, “Oh my God.”</p>
<hr />
<p>It had been only 12 hours since I had spoken to young Jenna through the music box and given her the final instructions, and it had been 22 hours since I’d spoken to Mrs. Goldberg.</p>
<p>I was waiting at Logan Airport with a sign in my hand that read “Jenna Price.” My body was full energy, and my heart had not slowed down in hours. It was happening. It was really happening.</p>
<p>The flight had arrived fifteen minutes ago, and at long last the weary passengers were disembarking. My eyes were locked on the sign that read: “NOW ARRIVING: 1412 LONDON.”</p>
<p>I wondered if I would recognize my sister. Three years was a long time, and she would have changed her appearance drastically. I couldn’t believe this was working.</p>
<p>The doors flew open and an attractive girl in some sort of boarding-school uniform burst through. Behind her by several feet I would see some less-enthusiastic passengers. She had been the first one off the plane, and now she was sprinting to me.</p>
<p>I dropped my sign, and hugged my baby sister. She was alive. She was here and she was <em>alive</em>.</p>
<p>“We thought you were dead,” I said. There was a lump in my throat.</p>
<p>She was crying and smiling as she said, “that was your idea stupid!”</p>
<p>“It worked,” I said. “I can’t believe it worked!”</p>
<p>“I still have it,” she said, and produced a sheet of paper from her pocket.</p>
<p>I grabbed it from her and read in nice handwriting:</p>
<p>RUN AWAY - MAY 10, 1996</p>
<p>AFTER SCHOOL</p>
<p>1229 CHERRY LANE</p>
<p>STAY WITH GOLDBERGS</p>
<p>MAY 10: MEGALOTTO: 10-23-26-30-39-7</p>
<p>MAY 14: STATE LOTTO: 2-9-18-23-29-49</p>
<p>PETER WILL GET YOU IN THREE YEARS</p>
<p>“This is awfully good handwriting for a 5-year-old,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s not quite so simple,” she said. “After you gave me those instructions, I didn’t stop talking to my music box.”</p>
<p>“I still keep talking to you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No. After that note, it was a woman who talked to me. A woman named Becky. Becky Goldberg.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that makes sense,” I said. “I didn’t think I was going to be able to entrust the whole plan into a 5-year-old in one night.”</p>
<p>Jenna pulled me to the side of the terminal, out of the way of the foot traffic. “I talked to… myself… for years on the music box. Up until the day I ran away. But I never understood why I had to go.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I understand it either,” I said. “It’s like the scratches I asked you to make on the box. They were already there when I asked you to make them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” she said.</p>
<p>I said, “I’m saying that I could ask you to do anything in <em>your</em> time, as long as it fit in with my perception of <em>my</em> time.</p>
<p>“In <em>my</em> time you had been abducted… I think… so I made you run away instead. It saved your life, without changing my perception of events- so that I still sent you the messages I needed to send you.”</p>
<p>She said, “Except I never was abducted.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “Maybe. Maybe time is a fixed thing, you always ran away because I always told you to…”</p>
<p>“I always thought maybe it was about the money,” she said.</p>
<p>“The lottery money?” I said, “No… I needed that so that the family who took you in would have a motivation to keep you hidden, and so they’d understand you were getting instructions from the future. I figured two consecutive lottery wins would be plenty of proof.”</p>
<p>“It was!” she said, “They were so nervous when the news reports started showing a missing girl. I told them not to worry… the money helped to keep them quiet, and it helped them hide me. Do you know I’ve been all over Europe?”</p>
<p>I smiled. It hit me again. I was talking to my missing sister. It was amazing.</p>
<p>“How did you choose the Goldbergs anyway?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” I said. “I read the papers to see who won a double-lotto the week you went missing. There they were.”</p>
<p>She hugged me again. “It’s so good to see you,” she said. “Where do we go from here?”</p>
<p>“Mom and Dad are waiting for us downstairs,” I said, “I didn’t tell them why they were here. I wanted to see if you were real first.”</p>
<p>“I’m real,” she said. I hugged her again.</p>
<p><em>She was</em>.</p>
<h2 id="follow-the-arrows-bathroom-graffiti">Follow the Arrows / Bathroom Graffiti</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/anexq/hey_reddit_what_awesome_graffiti_have_you_found/c0igyyg/?context=5">“Hey Reddit, what awesome graffiti have you found in bathrooms?”</a></p>
<p>When I was in a pub in on Long Island, I went to use the restrooms. When I was in the stall, I saw writing on the door that said: “follow the arrows”.</p>
<p>I looked around, but I didn’t see any arrows. Whatever, I didn’t think about it.</p>
<p>Then, about a month after that, I’m back in the same place- use the restroom to wash my hands before I tear into some buffalo wings.</p>
<p>They were out of paper towels, and not wanting to touch the restroom door with my hands, I tried to open it with my elbows. This was a clumsy processes, and resulted in my bumping a lightswitch with my elbow. The room went completely dark.</p>
<p>Or did it?</p>
<p>On the ceiling I notice a trail of glow-in-the-dark arrows painted onto the ceiling. They’re very very faded, looks like they’d been there for quite a while. The lead out the door.</p>
<p>Now I had totally forgotten about the graffiti I had read a month ago, so I didn’t really think about those arrows at all. I just pulled my sleeve over my wet hand, used it to flip the switch back on, and open the door.</p>
<p>I went back to my table with some buddies and we chowed down on some excellent wings. It wasn’t until the end of the evening when my brain, out of nowhere, remember the “follow the arrows” graffiti in the stall. I excuse myself from the table, just to check that it was this stall where I saw the writing. It was. Now I had a mystery.</p>
<p>I wanted to follow the arrows, but I couldn’t. After I left the restroom, the ambient light was so bright that the arrows were invisible.</p>
<p>I told my friends about the arrows, and I asked the bartender about it. He knew about the graffiti but had never seen the glow-in-the-dark arrows. After about 15 minutes of pouring drinks, he took a minute to go check it out.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem that impressed. I asked him if we could stay after closing and turn off all the lights to see where it went. He said yes.</p>
<p>Flash forward 2 hours. The bartender and some of the waitresses are all standing around in the dark of the bar, looking at little faded arrows that make a trail from the restroom out to the front door.</p>
<p>We step outside, but the trail is dead. The streetlights outside make the faded glow in the dark arrows impossible to see- if they were even there at all.</p>
<p>3 days later, I’m in the Geology I at my college, when I notice the display of exotic minerals that the department has in a display case. Inside the case is a small, handheld black light used by rock hounds to find and observe glow-in-the-dark minerals. After the class, I ask the professor if I can borrow it. He says yes, but that if I break it I owe the department $45.</p>
<p>Flash forward 9 hours. I drag my buddies back to the bar. We have some more drinks and awesome buffalo wings. When we’re done gorging ourselves it is already dark outside.</p>
<p>I went to the bathroom and tested my black light on some of the painted arrows. It worked like a charm- they glowed incredibly brightly, and even with the lights on they were fairly visible.</p>
<p>I went back to the table. We pay our tab, and step onto the street.</p>
<p>My friends stood around me, trying to look cool, while I was geeking out with my black light searching for invisible arrows on the ground. I found one.</p>
<p>I followed the arrow, keeping my black light inches from the ground, waving it back and forth… 5 feet away I found another arrow. Then another, and another still.</p>
<p>I was following these arrows down a side walk for about 2 blocks. My friends finally loosened up and started speculating on where the hell these arrows were taking us.</p>
<p>Finally I got to an arrow pointing us in a new direction… it was a driveway leading to an empty commercial lot of some kind. The lot was surrounded by cyclone fences with aluminum siding- we couldn’t see what was inside.</p>
<p>The arrows led us around the fence/wall to a gate.</p>
<p>I saw a lot of glow-in-the-dark paint under my light, and it took me a few seconds and some swinging of the light to realize we were looking at a giant arrow pointing inside the fence.</p>
<p>I guess I should introduce you to my friends now: One was Jeff, one was Dave.</p>
<p>Jeff, pushed on the gate. It was locked and it rattled terribly in the dark. Dave looked uncomfortable. He took a deep breath, and before he could say what I’m certain he was about to (“hey guys lets just go home”) I cut him off, “I say we hop this baby”.</p>
<p>Jeff didn’t even say anything before he leapt against the gate, getting a firm handhold at the top. Ungracefully, but successfully he pulled himself to an uncomfortable straddle on top of the gate.</p>
<p>I followed suit, leaping at the gate. I didn’t reach the top on my first attempt. I put the black light in my pocket and took a running leap at the gate I got a firm handhold, but I could fell the metal digging into my skin. I made a mental note to get a tetanus shot when this was all over.</p>
<p>Jeff helped me up from the top while Dave pushed my legs from underneath. Dave followed next with surprising ease.</p>
<p>From our perch on the gate, we could see that the fence surrounded what looked like an old parking lot. Grass and other green things sprang up from the ancient, crumbled asphalt.</p>
<p>Immediately below us, on the other side of the fence, was nothing but inky blackness from the shadow cast by the gate from a nearby street lamp. I pulled my black light from my pocket, but from this height, it was useless.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Dave was the first one to slide down into the dark. He slide down the fence as low as possible before letting go and taking the final plunge. We heard him stumble, curse quietly, and the stand.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he said, “I can see a little. It’s just asphalt.”</p>
<p>Jeff and I dropped down from the fence. I didn’t see exactly what happened, but after a lot of cursing, Jeff announced to us that he had busted his knee. After a minute of silent deliberation, he decided we should soldier on.</p>
<p>I pulled out my light and quickly found an arrow.</p>
<p>We followed a new trail slowly, and it quickly became clear that we were being led to a small shack in the middle of the parking lot.</p>
<p>“I know what this is,” said Dave. “I think this all used to be a drive-in movie theater. I think <em>that</em> is the concession stand.”</p>
<p>Jeff and I agreed that this was a pretty good theory.</p>
<p>We walked to the build, and as we got closer, saw that it was boarded up- but the shape of it, and it’s enormous boarded-up windows made us think that Dave was probably right.</p>
<p>Jeff pulled out a cellphone and held it high above his head. At first I couldn’t figure out why- then it became clear that he was using it as a flashlight to some faded lettering on the wall. We couldn’t really see it, but we decided it probably said “POPCORN”.</p>
<p>I held up my black light- it glowed purple and bright, but didn’t help us read the lettering any better than Jeff’s phone had. I scanned the ground for more arrows and found none.</p>
<p>Dave shrugged, “So, what? The arrows used to lure people to buy popcorn?”</p>
<p>“Looks like,” Jeff said.</p>
<p>We walked around the building until we came to a door in the back. It was secured by an old combination padlock. My black light hung from a tie on my wrist. I thought I had shut it off now that our mystery was solved, but out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of glowing paint.</p>
<p>I aimed my light at it.</p>
<p>“Whoa!” said Dave. Maybe we all said it- we were thinking it.</p>
<p>There on the door, in sharp, new glowing paint was scrawled “1-3-5-6”.</p>
<p>Holding the black light close, we quickly rotated the wheels on the lock. Jeff pulled it open with a satisfying click.</p>
<p>Pulling the padlock aside, we pushed on the old door. It creaked ominously… and got stuck when it was about a third of the way open.</p>
<p>Jeff kicked his foot around the inside and moved an obstruction with thud. The door opened halfway now, and Jeff peeked inside.</p>
<p>“I can’t see anything,” he said.</p>
<p>I peeked inside the door, shining my black light. It was useless. I cursed myself for not bring a real flashlight. A black light and a cell phone were not enough to explore in there.</p>
<p>“Its useless,” I said, "as I pulled back from the door.</p>
<p>Dave took his turn peering in. Just I was about to suggest we head back to return another day, I heard a click, and a dim light appeared within the building.</p>
<p>“Holy shit,” said Dave, “I flipped the light switch, but I never thought in a million years that it would work.”</p>
<p>Jeff said, “Yeah, this place looks like it’s been out of use for like- 30 years at least! Look at this parking lot! There are trees in it!”</p>
<p>“Someone’s still paying the bills,” I said, and pushed on Dave to get him headed into the building.</p>
<p>We walked in, and saw a surprisingly clean concession stand interior. There was thin coating of that strange sort of dust that accumulates in the absence of people… The sort of dust you would expect to find in an ancient tomb.</p>
<p>The shelves were empty, and a cabinet stood on the far side of the room, doors closed. Dave walked to it and opened it cautiously.</p>
<p>“Holy, goat fucker,” he said. He always had an interesting way with words. I looked past him to see what had impressed him.</p>
<p>“Jeezus,” I agreed. We were looking at shelves and shelves packed with candy boxes. But not just any candy boxes- really old stuff- I recognized Cracker-Jacks and Hershey’s but the labels were ancient.</p>
<p>I dropped my black light on the floor and grabbed excitedly for a giant box of Necco-Waffers. “This has to be worth something,” I said.</p>
<p>Before I could examine further, Jeff said, “Dudes, check this out!”</p>
<p>He was standing over a hatch in the floor. He’d pulled it up and was peering into the dark. “Maybe there’s another light down there?”</p>
<p>He bounded down a set of steps into the cellar. Dave and I followed close behind, trying to find a switch along the way.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t been in such a hurry to keep up with Jeff, I might have noticed that the black light I had dropped was illuminating some more glowing paint. And if I had noticed that, I might also have noticed that the paint made an arrow was pointing directly towards this basement hatch. And if I had noticed that, it might have given me pause. But I did not notice these things.</p>
<p>I was halfway to the bottom of the stairs when I heard a click. My eyes were immediately drawn to a glow in the corner of the basement. Jeff said, “found it.”</p>
<p>We walked toward the light, bumping into empty shelves and some strange debris along the way. Canvas bags, like sacks of potatoes. They were covered in dust. I was move concerned with the shelf under the light. It held what I recognized as old film canisters. Truly these were treasure.</p>
<p>We hurried over, reading the titles. Lots of things with monsters, “Dracula Returns”, “Night of the Wolf People” - great stuff. But I didn’t recognize any of the titles.</p>
<p>We all jumped when we heard it.</p>
<p>There was whirring sound… very loud, coming from near the stairs. It sounded somehow familiar, like a garbage disposal or some electric power tool. We saw the shadows changing from the light in the hatchway.</p>
<p>We had nearly knocked over the shelf with the film reels. I had involuntarily thrown my hands over my ears. Dave and Jeff had comical , frightened expressions on their faces. I probably looked the same.</p>
<p>At last the sound stopped. We stood still for a moment, our hearts beating hard in our chests.</p>
<p>Then, as if awakening from a trance, we all ran over to the hatch to investigate. My mind could not comprehend what it saw. Was the ceiling upstairs covered in black stripes?</p>
<p><em>NO</em>. My eyes finally understood. The hatch we had just come down moments ago was now blocked by iron bars.</p>
<p>Jeff bolted up the stairs as far as he could, grasping the iron bars in his hands and pushing against them violently. But his shaking and jarring only served to rattle the creaky wooden staircase.</p>
<p>Dave stood there, pale and dumb, staring at the bars. His mind trying to comprehend this impossible situation.</p>
<p>I walked to the back of the stairs and saw the motorized contraption attached to iron bars. It was so dark though, that I could barely make it out.</p>
<p>I reached for my black light, realizing that I had left it upstairs. “Jeff! Get over here!” I barked.</p>
<p>Jeff stood next to me and looked at the contraption. He help up his cell phone and in the phone’s dim light we a giant metal box that had been cleverly mounted to the basement ceiling. If there were way to access this device, we could not see it.</p>
<p>Dave gasped suddenly, and ran to one of the potato sacks I’d seen on the floor. He dragged it into the light, worked to untie it. When he was done, I saw him look into the bag and make a sound I’d never heard before- something between a scream and a moan. He started hyperventilating.</p>
<p>Jeff and I ran over to him. Jeff said some comforting words to Dave while I looked into the bag.</p>
<p>At first I couldn’t tell what I was looking at. For some reason I thought it was tree roots or some sort of stew vegetables. Then I saw the hair.</p>
<p>I vomited violently, away from the others.</p>
<p>I tried to speak, but vomited again. Throat raw, I said to Jeff, “your phone! call the police, call them now!”</p>
<p>I put my hand on Dave’s shoulder. Dave who was slowly rocking back and forth like a baby. He was trying to slow down his breathing, but it was coming quickly in gasping rasps.</p>
<p>I heard Jeff get through to someone on the phone. He explained where the bar was, and how we had walked several blocks to a parking lot with a fence around it. He explained the concession stand, and the basement and the locking iron bars.</p>
<p>They wanted him to stay on the line, I asked him for the phone.</p>
<p>“Look,” I said, “there are dead bodies in bags down here-” I looked around. “dozens of them.”</p>
<p>It was a woman on the other end. She said, “Just stay calm. I want you to just stay on line with me, and give me your names.”</p>
<p>We told her who we were, and answered her check list of questions. I knew we should conserve the phone batteries, but she was our lifeline out of this crazy situation.</p>
<p>After we’d answered all her questions, she said, “You know, making prank calls to emergency rescue services is a very serious crime.”</p>
<p>My blood turned cold. She thought we we joking. My throat tightened.</p>
<p>As calmly as I could, I croaked, “Ma’am I swear to you, I have never been more serious in my life. Please send someone down here. If we’re lying you can arrest us- just send someone PLEASE.”</p>
<p>“Young man,” she said, “don’t you have better things to do on a school night?”</p>
<p>I heard a click- then nothing.</p>
<p>I hung up the phone. “She… didn’t believe us”</p>
<p>Dave said, “give me the phone.”</p>
<p>I noticed he had calmed down significantly.</p>
<p>I saw him dial the operator. In a moment he spoke. Calmly he said, “operator, I’d like to speak to New Hyde Park police please. Yes, it is an emergency. No I don’t want 9-1-1 or dispatch. I want the police department.”</p>
<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then he spoke in a deep voice, “Yes, hello officer, I’d like to report some kids in an abandoned building. They were throwing bottles and wrecking the place. I saw them drag a little girl in there into the basement- it sounds awful bad- just awful bad. Someone needs to hurry before they hurt that little girl.”</p>
<p>Dave- fucking brilliant Dave. I could have kissed him. He gave the officer the location of the lot and the description. It was perfect. After answering some more the officers questions, he begged her once again to hurry. But already I heard the sound of a car pulling up outside.</p>
<p>Dave hung up the phone. “That was too fast,” he said.</p>
<p>“Maybe the 9-1-1 lady actually sent someone? To arrest us maybe?”</p>
<p>I heard a car door open, then close, then there were heavy steps. Jeff ran to the barred hatch, “We’re down here! Help! Please! We’re down here!”</p>
<p>The footsteps were slow and deliberate overhead. I saw a pair of work boots and dirty bluejeans appear at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>Jeff stepped clumsily backwards down the stairs. He looked pale. I moved to the base of the stairs by his side, and looked up.</p>
<p>He was a bear of a man. Just intimidatingly large. He was smoking a cigarette. He stared at us without really seeing us- as if were just shirts on a hanger and he was trying to decide which one to wear.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” I said. But he walked away as if he hadn’t heard me.</p>
<p>“HEY! HEY!” I screamed as I ran up the stairs to the bars, but I could think of nothing else to say… he walked outside.</p>
<p>We heard him get something heavy out of his vehicle. Then we heard him dragging it inside. Whatever it was, he set it down with a thump.</p>
<p>There was some fussing about upstairs, and then we saw plastic tarp rolled across the iron bars. moments later, the sound of duct tape.</p>
<p>The hatch was closed, and we were alone listening to the sounds of the man working. Working, we were sure, on something evil. The sort of evil that is rarely seen. The sort of evil that you don’t get to tell anyone about later on.</p>
<p>We heard a hissing sound- high pitched and steady.</p>
<p>I was confused, so was Jeff.</p>
<p>“Gas,” said Dave. “I think he’s pumping some sort of gas in here.”</p>
<p>We ran around looking for the source. But we were lightheaded within minutes.</p>
<p>I heard Jeff collapse in the far corner. Dave rushed over and tried to pull him over to me.</p>
<p>Dave fell 10 feet away from me, breathing shallowly, unconscious but not dead.</p>
<p>I heard sirens in the distance. And then there was nothing.</p>
<h3 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h3>
<p>I’d often imagined death as a cold thing, but when it arrived it was warm and numb. And there was the hissing gas- white noise, like static on a radio. And then it was gone. There were voices from heaven. They wanted to know about a little girl, I think. Then there was the whistling.</p>
<p>It was a merry little tune from a bear of man. How did I know him? Everything is foggy when you’re dead.</p>
<p>Did you know that when you’re dead you can hear your friends whispering to you? I heard Dave’s voice in my ear. He kept saying “phone”. Isn’t that a funny thing to say to a dead person?</p>
<p>Hey, <em>this</em> is interesting: dead people get to keep their toes! I couldn’t believe it either until they started tingling.</p>
<p>I could hear someone chopping a tree in the distance. But it was a tree made of meat. You could tell by the sloshing sounds. Everything is foggy when you’re dead.</p>
<p>You know, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Being dead really wasn’t so bad once you got the hang of it. For example, when you’re dead, you should always keep your eyes closed- otherwise the light pours right into your head and fills you up with pain.</p>
<p>When you’re dead things don’t always make sense. The thing that I found most confusing was why Jeff’s head was rolling around on the floor. Heads aren’t supposed to do that. Why did death have to be so <em>foggy</em>?</p>
<p>I think the reason I could hear Dave whispering was because he was dead too. I figured that part out when I felt his hand on my face. WHOA…. I still have a face. Death is just too much! Wish I could tell someone about it.</p>
<p>I thought about saying ‘hi’ to Dave, but a funny thought occurred to me… I think that death might just be a room- a dark room with stairs and sacks full of tree roots and stew vegetables. Also the floor is red.</p>
<p>Dave stopped saying “phone”- mostly because he was sliding away. He was crying I think. But the whistling was very happy, so that was nice. Hey, someone’s chopping another meat tree. Meat trees… I wonder why I’ve never seen one? If I open my eyes I could see one now.</p>
<p>Oh dear, that’s not a meat tree at all. Someone is chopping up Dave. That’s very strange thing to be doing. No wonder he looks so sad. You know, I bet I could make Dave feel better if I could give him a phone.</p>
<p>Hey! Look at that! Jeff’s phone is right next to my hand. You know what? When you’re dead I think you get to keep your whole body. Look, I’ve got hands and feet and everything! I can even pick things up.</p>
<p>My hand doesn’t work very well anymore, but it’s good enough to move the phone close where I can see it.</p>
<p>“Redialing.” I used to know what that word meant back when I was alive. It’s flashing at me now. And now I hear more voices from heaven. They keep saying “hello?” I think they want me to talk. I should probably say something. But what should I say?</p>
<p>“Help?” Is that what I said? It’s not so foggy now. I’m sure I said “help.”</p>
<p>But why would I have said such a thing unless I was in trouble?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>“Help me. Help me. I’m not dead.” It comes out as a croaky whisper. It was a scream in my mind.</p>
<p>“I’m not dead,” I say again, as I feel strong large hands on my ankles.</p>
<p>“I’m not dead,” I say as he pulls me through the puddle of blood, still warm.</p>
<p>“I’m not dead,” I say as he pulls me onto a plastic tarp and whistles his joyful melody.</p>
<p>I watch him sharpening his blade- a meat cleaver, I think. I never was one for cooking. Why is he whistling?</p>
<p>I’m trying so hard to move, but my body will not obey. He moves so easily. I envy him for it. What a strange thought. What a strange situation. How many others have there been like me, who have had to watch their murderers prepare for the kill?</p>
<p>I think of a bug I saw once, caught in a spider web. No. That can’t be my last thought. My last thought should be something nice.</p>
<p>He’s done sharpening now. And he raises the heavy blade over my body.</p>
<p>I’ll think about my parents. I’ll think about my sister. I’ll think about the ocean, the girls I’ve kissed, the ones I haven’t kissed, the kids I’ll never have, the books I’ll never read. This is my last chance! I’ll think about them all at once. I swear to God I will.</p>
<p>“I’m not dead,” I say.</p>
<p>And then, I am.</p>
<h3 id="alternate-ending-i">Alternate Ending I</h3>
<p>When I awoke, I realized two things about my face. The first thing was that it hurt a lot. The second thing was that it was on a concrete floor.</p>
<p>I tried to sit upright, but as I pushed myself from the floor my arms gave out on me. I was so weak. My head weighed 100 pounds.</p>
<p>I heard grunting and coughing behind me. Startled, I rolled over and saw Dave as he began to come around. There was a moment of confusion, as I looked around the dusty room. Then it all snapped back in place.</p>
<p>Adrenaline pumping, my muscles found new strength. I grabbed Dave’s collar, “Dave, we’ve got to get the fu-“</p>
<p>I stopped midsentence as I heard voices upstairs.</p>
<p>The first voice said, “excuse me sir, we’ve had reports of a disturbance out here. Have you heard anything unusual?”</p>
<p>There was very long pause, and the a baritone voice said, “yes sir, officer… there were some kids in this place making a hell of a racket… I came over here to clear ‘em out.”</p>
<p>The police officer asked, “you own this property?”</p>
<p>But the man didn’t get a chance to answer because I started screaming bloody murder. Dave joined me. Jeff stirred but I was to busy running up the stairs and pounding on the hatch to pay attention.</p>
<p>Dave grabbed a couple of metal film canisters and smashed them together, making an unholy racket.</p>
<p>If any more dialog was exchanged upstairs, we didn’t hear it, what we did hear was a scuffle than ensued. The men upstairs were slamming each other into the walls. One of them fell to the floor. There was a heavy thud, a gunshot, and then another. Finally we heard a second body slump to the floor.</p>
<p>We all stayed silent for a moment, praying the police officer was triumphant. We heard nothing.</p>
<p>“Officer?” I shouted through the hatch.</p>
<p>I heard a moan. Then, “I… I think I’m hurt… I think… I think…” and then there was nothing.</p>
<p>“Officer?!” I shouted again, and pounded on the hatch. There was no response.</p>
<p>Jeff and Dave were behind me at the base of the stairs. Dave said, “we need to get the hatch open.”</p>
<p>There was more stirring upstairs. But it was from the direction of the second thud. I was pretty sure it was our captor. My heart pounded.</p>
<p>I heard something smash in the dark of the basement. I spun to see Dave destroying a metal shelf. He ripped off a sturdy, narrow metal support piece and then ran up next to me on the stairs.</p>
<p>Dave wedged the metal piece through the iron bars, and pushed upwards against the hatch. In the process, he created a small rip in the plastic tarp. I immediately began clawing at the tarp like a crazed cat.</p>
<p>Jeff followed Dave’s lead and grabbed another piece of the destroyed shelf, wedged it between the iron bars, and pushed.</p>
<p>We heard the welcome groan of bending wood, followed by a delightful snap. The hatch, and part of its frame swung upwards a few inches. It was clear that something was on top of the hatch.</p>
<p>I pushed through the bars with my bare hands, as Jeff and Dave redoubled their efforts. We heard something heavy and metallic crash over on its side. The hatch door swung open, allowing the us to see the scene above.</p>
<p>A police officer lay a several feet away from where we stood. Something was sticking out of the side of his head. A kitchen knife! It was ghastly. The worst part was the man’s eyes. They were alert! He was looking at me.</p>
<p>It was clear that he could not speak and his right hand, still grasping a small revolver, was experiencing some sort of rhythmic tremor.</p>
<p>The officer kept shifting his eyes from my gaze to a point somewhere behind me. He did this twice before I understood. I turned to where he wanted me to look. Against the far wall, the large bear of a man was trying to use the wall to pull himself to an upright position. The man had been shot in the leg, and in the shoulder. He looked pale but determined.</p>
<p>I reached out for the officer’s gun. His eyes tried to tell me something. He wanted to hand me the gun but could not. His mouth opened and closed like a fish. An awful gibberish came out- something that wanted to be words, but were spilling forth from a dying brain.</p>
<p>I strained my arm to its limit feeling the iron bars pressing into my flesh. My fingertip touched the barrel of the gun but I couldn’t quite reach it. The cop made another awful sound and flexed his torso. His body lurched closer to me and I gripped the gun firmly. I pulled it from the officer’s hand, and quickly reoriented myself to point it at the large man. The bars made this a difficult task, and by the time I got my arm facing the right direction, my view of the man was obstructed by the open hatch door, as it lay on top some contraption… the gas canisters perhaps?</p>
<p>I ducked down with Dave and Jeff. “I got the cops gun. He has knife in his head. The big guy is over there,” I pointed, “but I can’t get a shot.”</p>
<p>Dave said, “how many bullets?”</p>
<p>I glanced down, “I think 3? No, 4.”</p>
<p>Dave whispered, “we could get under him and try to shoot him through the floor.”</p>
<p>We heard the large man groan and move closer the hatch. aimed the gun in the direction from which I thought he might appear.</p>
<p>Dave left the stairs and was circling around underneath where he thought the man might be.</p>
<p>We heard the clanking of metal canisters and I watched a large cylindrical container get pulled towards where I knew the man to be. I aimed through the hatchway door and fired a shot.</p>
<p>The sound was deafening and the kickback from the small gun was much more than I was expecting. My ears rang and there was a sharp pain in my wrist.</p>
<p>There was silence form the other side of the open hatch door, and then movementmore frantic this time. I heard cursing and something that sounded like the valve of a garden hose turning.</p>
<p>The hissing sound returned- the gas again! Jeff and Dave both dashed to the top of the stairs with me. We all tried dislodging the iron bars.</p>
<p>Without words we synchronized our motions: pushing, pulling, twisting, jarringuntil finally it gave- not much, just and inch. We couldn’t tell what had moved, we just knew that when we pulled on the iron bars now, they would all shift back and forth.</p>
<p>All the while, an ominous hissing filled the air. I felt as though we were trapped in a snake pit. I could smell it a little now- the strange odor that had overtaken me earlier. I stuck my face up to the bars and inhaled a lung-full of the untainted air. Dave and Jeff followed suit.</p>
<p>We all ripped fiercely at the bars, and at last, I could see the whole clever device as it was pried from the basement ceiling. It must have been 8 to 10 feet long. Dave saw it to, but he must have understood something that I did not because he said, “When I pull, you pull.”</p>
<p>He took a lungful of good air and ran down the stairs, around to the far end of the contraption. He leapt at it yanked hard at some unseen element in ceiling. Jeff and I put all our weight on bars, and at long last, the enormous contraption fell. Dave took a step or two back towards us, but collapsed as the gas overtook him.</p>
<p>I was starting to get tunnel-vision as Jeff and I tried to push the dislodged iron bars and their frame out of the way of the hatch. We did so with moderate success. Half the hatchway was clear. Jeff was in a better position, so he climbed out first. My head was spinning now, as I saw the huge man spring out from his hiding place a clobber Jeff with some sort of wrench.</p>
<p>I was having trouble thinking. I wanted to shoot this man. Where had I put the gun?!</p>
<p>I didn’t see it. There was no time. I needed air.</p>
<p>I pulled myself out of the hatch and inhaled deeply twice. My perceptions were dull because of the gas, and so I did not expect the blow as his boot slammed into my already injured face. I tumbled down the stairs, but found my footing near the bottom. And then- a miracle.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs was the revolver. I must have dropped in the frenzy to pry the bars loose. I grabbed for the gun, and involuntarily inhaled a deep breath of the powerful gas.</p>
<p>The world collapsed in around me… I could not see.</p>
<p>But I still felt the gun in my hand and the stairs beneath my feet. I charged upwards shooting wildly into the dark. I heard a grunt, and I felt myself run into the open hatchway door. The exertion was too much, I tumbled forward and down, down, down into nothingness.</p>
<p>When I awoke I was being loaded into an ambulance. I grabbed the arm of paramedic who was lifting me in. “Stop,” I said. “My friends? What happened to my friends?”</p>
<p>The paramedic just gave me a sad look and shook her head. They finished loading me in and slammed the doors. I closed my eyes, too weary to think. I drifted back into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>One year later there was a memorial service at my school. I showed up with a girl I’d been seeing for a couple months- a real sweetheart. I think you’d approve. I was wearing my best suit and in my hand was a sweaty piece of paper with my idea of a speech on it.</p>
<p>I walked to the podium, and cleared my throat. I said a few words about how I met Dave, and what a great guy he was. I told them all how he’d charged into a room full of potentially deadly gas, to help Jeff and me escape from a madman. My voice sounded funny through the speakers. The damage to my face was extensive. I’ve had two surgeries, one more scheduled for the fall. I look okay, but it’s affected the way I talk.</p>
<p>When I was done speaking I walked over to Dave’s family and hugged his mother. She didn’t want to let me go. Dave’s father patted me on the shoulder as he choked back a sob.</p>
<p>I walked back to my seat. “Stop looking around,” my girlfriend scolded. I pretended I didn’t know what she was talking about.</p>
<p>“You knew he wasn’t coming,” she said.</p>
<p>“I know,” I said.</p>
<p>When we got back to my dorm room, Jeff was waiting on the front steps. The blow he took to the head had knocked out the vision in his left eye. These days he work opaque sunglasses all the time, to hide his wandering eye. I still greeted him with an “ARRRRGGG” or a “Shiver-me-timbers” from when the days when he wore an eye patch. Not today though.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t go,” he said, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>I nodded and we all went inside.</p>
<p>We heated up some lunch, on our contraband hotplate, and turned on the television for some background noise. My girlfriend flipped to the school’s own CCTV channel, and watched a report on the memorial. We’d seen the cameras there covering the event live.</p>
<p>The student reporter told our story: Of Dave who gave his life, of Jeff who lost an eye, and any ability he ever had to do long division (which probably wasn’t that much of a loss), and of me, and my face.</p>
<p>She went on to mention Officer Stanley Bell, who died that night, leaving a wife and two children.</p>
<p>She talked about the concession stand, and how it was rigged with motion sensors to capture the curious in a dungeon of death. And how the killer had rigged those motion sensors to the telephone lines so that his phone would ring 3 times when someone entered his trap. She talked about the 37 bodies in canvas sacks that had been accumulating since 1957.</p>
<p>And then they showed the artist’s rendering of the man I described to her as “a bear of a man”. He is still at large, identity unknown. I inhaled slowly and closed my eyes. I tried to remind myself that I was one of the lucky ones.</p>
<p>I went to lay down in my room and take a nap. My girlfriend followed me a minute later, and curled herself around me. She left the light on. I always sleep with the light on.</p>

<p>“That asshole” he thought. “I’ll have to take a look at the restaurant too, but the theatre is going to be shut down.” The inspector’s snarky voice repeated in his head. Something about zoning and unsafe structures. He knew what it was about. It was about the girl. They had been chasing the same girl for months. She was a real piece too, short skirts, bouncy hair, bubbly. He was with her now. He won the girl, now he had to win the fight too? I’d kill him if I could.</p>
<p>That thought popped into his head a few times that night. How sweet the revenge would be. She would be distressed, of course, but he would be there to console her. Plus if he was dead they wouldn’t inspect the restaurant. He was only inspecting it to because of its owner.</p>
<p>That evening he drove down the street to the theatre. The screen was what ruined it. Too tall for its proximity to the street, they said. He unlocked the concession stand and strode in. Melissa would be out of a job now too. Remember how scared she was the first time she had to go downstairs to the ice room?</p>
<p>“Why can’t we keep the ice up there?”</p>
<p>“It’s cooler underground, the ice will melt to quick, we can’t afford that.” It was just a small basement to the concession stand. On one end there were blocks of ice surrounding soft drinks and ice cream, on the other he stored the film rolls. He had thought before about keeping secrets down here, but never with kids working here in the summer. Never secrets like this.</p>
<p>“I’ll be conducting my inspection on Monday. That gives you the weekend to prepare, I’m only waiting that long out of kindness. Please don’t make me close you restaurant, too.” Might as well clean it up, make it look good. He knew it would get closed no matter what he did. It wasn’t it bad shape, but there were faults to find. He knew how to keep it open.</p>
<p>The idea struck him as he was cleaning. “If I leave a trail, and he follows it, he’s really killing himself” he thought. It’s not a trap, exactly, after all, the place was condemned. They always check bathrooms with black lights, it’s a great way to make sure they’re being cleaned thoroughly. He would follow it too, trying to find something else wrong. He would follow it right to the ice room.</p>
<p>Monday came, and the inspector showed up early, as he knew would happen.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you to it, then.” He had to leave, otherwise the inspector couldn’t, wouldn’t follow the trail. He stood by the screen at the theatre, not completely hidden, but inconspicuous enough. What would he say? What would he do? He couldn’t follow through with it. A game for his summer workers, he would say, that’s all it was. He was getting shut down anyway, this little fault wouldn’t matter. No, he had come this far, the trap was set, the weapon in place, no one would ever know.</p>
<p>He saw him wander outside, flashlight in hand. He glanced around, make sure no one was watching. The arrows were there, hidden until hit with his light. Just do this. He followed the path exactly. The door to the stand gave him pause, but after a sly look in all directions, he found the combination, opened it and followed inside. Now. Now was the chance. He could fix everything right now.</p>
<p>It was cold inside the concession stand. The hatch to the ice room was open. He had glanced in the window to see it empty. He closed the hatch as gently as he could, but the darkness downstairs gave him away.</p>
<p>“Hey! What the fuck! I’ll shut you down for this! I’ll take your house!” It didn’t matter. He had to follow through with it now. The gas tank was in place. Propane is heavier than air, so it sinks down into the basement. One tank should be enough, but he borrowed a spare from his grill just in case. The hose was already fed into a hole in the floor. Slowly he turned the valve. The hissing was imperceptible over the shouts. More shouts, more threats. After a minute he turned the valve on the second tank. Speed things up, easier for both. The screaming continued. Beating on the hatch continued. Almost as soon as he descended the steps the screaming stopped. Better wait another few minutes, just to make sure. He opened the hatch slowly to gasp at the propane. After what seemed like hours he descended into scarcely breathable air. The body was put in an old reel bag and placed behind the other movie reels. No one would ever know.</p>
<p>The police interviewed him, of course. He had gone home, he said, during the inspection, and when he returned he couldn’t find the inspector. A weak story, to be sure. They searched the restaurant, dusted for prints, scanned for blood. They never found anything. They never thought to use UV light.</p>
<p>There were more. Twenty-somethings getting curious about the arrows. The first one scared him, the thought of someone finding his secret. He followed him, in the shadows, and gave him the same punishment as the inspector. No one could know. He did the same with the bodies, meticulously placing each one in a bag, dousing them with formaldehyde to mask the scent and slow the decay. You could smell it, but not from outside. Eventually they fenced off the old theatre, did him a favor really, as he still owned the property. But the people kept coming, striding proudly with curiosity into their demise.</p>

<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/anxu1/reddit_i_suck_at_drawing_how_do_i_get_better/">“Reddit, I suck at drawing. How do I get better?”</a></p>
<p>I’m glad you asked. I have also struggled with drawing. When I was little, I could never stay inside the lines in coloring books. As I got old I took some classes but nothing really helped. I could not make the images in my head appear on the paper. Everything changed when I met Sang-Tua, the Craftsman.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Sang-Tua is a kind of underground celebrity in art world. He designs moving sculptures from liquids and plastic casts. His work has been displayed all over the world. There is a show at the MET in NY this year. You should check it out if you get a chance.</p>
<p>I met Sang-Tua in undergrad when he was a guest lecturer for some sort of seminar that the liberal arts school was hosting. I didn’t see the lecture, though in retrospect I wish I had. No, I met Sang-Tua as he was being accosted by campus security for cutting down a tree with a pocketknife.</p>
<p>Sang-Tua was wearing an ill-fitting business suit. He’d cut the bottom half of the legs off the suit, to turn them into the ugliest shorts you’ve ever seen. On his feet were a pair of simple leather sandals.</p>
<p>If you had seen these things you would not have noticed. What you would have noticed was the tri-corner hat he was wearing. You know the kind- like the Americans wore during colonial times.</p>
<p>The security guards were standing about 10 feet away from Sang-Tua. One of them gripping his belt as if he had a gun to pull out. Of course he didn’t and this was before tasers- so I was think maybe pepper spray? The other guard was talking into his radio, saying how they were having an “incident”.</p>
<p>I had noticed the situation too late, as I only became aware of this complete loony when I was about 5 feet away from him, as I exited the administration building. I saw the guards first, because one of them was making a hell fuss.</p>
<p>I thought he was talking to me at first, but I quickly realized that he was talking to crazy-McGee over here next to me, as he was attempting to cut down this significantly sized tree, beaver-style with a pocketknife.</p>
<p>“Dude,” I said, because I talked like a jackass in those days. “Dude, those guys are getting pissed, you might want to put that knife way.”</p>
<p>The strange man kept on chipping bits of wood, and he did not turn to me as he said, “Knife will know when work is done. I no need tell it.” His accent was foreign and strange to my ears.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but, dude,” I continued, “you’re kind of destroying campus property.”</p>
<p>The man said, “Campus will no mind. Campus will keep wood. Campus will keep, also, much beauty.”</p>
<p>Now the guards were talking to me, “Hey kid, why don’t you step away from this guy before you get hurt.”</p>
<p>The man said, “I no hurt boy. Boy stay. Boy maybe learn something. Not like you teach. Maybe learn to see.”</p>
<p>The campus guard said, “You’re getting him agitated. Take a hike.”</p>
<p>I said, “he seems pretty calm to me.”</p>
<p>Before the guard could replay the man said, “See? Boy want to stay. You go. I teach.”</p>
<p>At that moment an Assistant Dean stepped out of the administration building behind me. He said to the man, “Excuse me? Just what do you think you’re doing?!”</p>
<p>“I am fixing the beauty,” said the man.</p>
<p>“You are destroying school property,” said the Assistant Dean.</p>
<p>The man stopped chipping away at the tree and turned to face the Assistant Dean. He spoke calmly, “You invite me come here- teach art. Then you invite me talk art. No one understand talk art. Now, I do art. Boy learn. Maybe you learn too?”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean was at a loss for how to handle this man. “You say we invited you?”</p>
<p>The man nodded. “You say ‘Sang-Tua, come teach art’. I come teach art.”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean was exasperated, “I don’t understand how destroying school property is art,” he said.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh,” said the Sang-Tua. “You see building? How long has building stand here?”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean thought. “Uh, this building has been around since at least 1933.”</p>
<p>“Yes, is old building,” said Sang-Tua. “How long, you think window there?”</p>
<p>He was pointing to a second-story window in the center of the administration building. The tree’s branches had grown to obscure it. The Assistant Dean said, “Same amount of time I guess. That’s my office window. What about it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, is old window,” said Sang-Tua. “How long you think tree grow here?”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean shrugged, “I don’t know- fifty years maybe?”</p>
<p>Sang-Tua nodded, “I think tree here sixty years.”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean waited for more, but the man just turned and resumed chipping at the tree. I notice he seemed fairly close to felling the thing.</p>
<p>“…AND?!” said the Assistant Dean, impatiently.</p>
<p>Sang-Tua said, “You go to office. You look out window. You will understand.”</p>
<p>I said, “I think he’s almost done, anyway.”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean shot me a cold look. Then he looked at the damage to the tree and told the guards to keep everyone away.</p>
<p>The man paused and looked at the Assistant Dean again. “You go to office now. Take boy. You will understand. He will learn.”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean paused and said to the man, “you don’t even think about leaving.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The Assistant Dean went back into the Administration Building and I followed in after him. We walked a set of old creaky stairs and then walk into the Assistant Dean’s office. He pulled open the blinds, revealing a view of some campus buildings to the left, and then in the center and right field of view, nothing but branches and leaves.</p>
<p>In a few moments we heard an ominous creaking sound, and the branches of the tree swayed as if by a breeze. But the air was still. Slowly, the branches fell away from us, and the air was filled with the sound of shattering wood as the tree scraped its neighbors on the way down. For the Assistant Dean and I, the landscape erupted before us. An extraordinary view of the campus was revealed.</p>
<p>In fact, I noticed now that it looked as if the entire campus had been designed to be on display for this very window. Distant footpaths on in the far corner of the campus were aligned in perfect straight lines that intersected directly beneath us at the entrance to the building. I had never noticed it from below, but from this height it was perfectly clear.</p>
<p>The structures of the surrounding buildings had always seemed odd and arbitrary, but now I could see that the buildings and their rooftops had been designed to allow this window to have an unobstructed line of sight to and old church and bell tower to one side, and to the distant city skyline in another. Every bit of the landscape was designed to be seen by someone standing right where we were. The tree had crept in slowly over the decades, obscuring a view that should have been maintained.</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean said, “Well, will you look at that?” He was smiling.</p>
<p>The campus security officers were standing around looking dumb when we got back downstairs. They couldn’t believe how out of hand this situation had gotten. The Assistant Dean instructed the guards to contact the groundskeepers to arrange for immediate disposal of the felled tree.</p>
<p>Turning to the man the Assistant Dean said, “Well, I certainly see your point. That was a lovely view.”</p>
<p>“<em>IS</em> a lovely view,” corrected Sang-Tua.</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean said, “Fine- <em>Is</em> a lovely view, Mr. Sooong??”</p>
<p>“S<em>A</em>ng-Tua,” he said.</p>
<p>“Mr. Sang-Tua,” said the Assistant Dean, “how much longer do you plan to be on my campus?”</p>
<p>Sang-Tua said, “Three days, three nights and of course, what future bring.”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean rolled his eyes. “Alright, well, how about you give me the knife and you can pick it up when you leave?”</p>
<p>Sang-Tua handed him the knife. “If cut down tree, you sharpen first.”</p>
<p>“I’m just going to hold on to it,” said the Assistant Dean. “Please refrain from destroying anything else while you’re here.”</p>
<p>“But beauty dem-,” began Sang-Tua.</p>
<p>“JUST leave it ugly, okay?” the Assistant Dean cut him off.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, I see,” said Sang-Tua. “Fixing school like choosing wife: ugly not matter when old and rich.”</p>
<p>The Assistant Dean couldn’t tell if Sang-Tua had meant it as a joke, and Sang-Tua’s face gave no clues. “I’m going home. If you have no more business here today, I suggest you do the same.”</p>
<p>After he left, one of the campus security officers pointed an aggressive finger at Sang-Tua, “You behave yourself,” he said. “And don’t touch any more trees. If I catch you so much as mowing the lawn-“</p>
<p>The other security guard cut him off by gently pulling him over to their car. They got in and in moments were gone. I turned to face Sang-Tua and found him staring at me.</p>
<p>Sang-Tua said, “Now, you come with me.”</p>
<p>He started walking and when I asked him where we were going he just said, “Why you ask question, when you know time will reveal answer?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t think of a good response.</p>
<p>I followed him to one of the campus parking lots, and soon it occurred to me that we were heading towards his car. I thought this was very strange, as for some reason I just couldn’t picture this man behind the wheel of an automobile.</p>
<p>We walked until he we reached a Jaguar. “Nice wheels,” I said.</p>
<p>He shook his head, “Car run like shit, but girls no mind. Think is sexy.”</p>
<p>He unlocked the car and handed me the keys, “You know how drive car?”</p>
<p>He was already getting in the passenger seat when I said, “well, yeah but-“</p>
<p>The slam of his car door cut me short. I walked around and got in on the driver’s side.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” I asked.</p>
<p>He took off his ridiculous hat and threw it into the back seat. “I could totally go for a burger now. How about you?” His accent was gone. I just stared at him.</p>
<p>“What?” was all I could think to say.</p>
<p>“Let’s do a good burger place, though- or maybe a steakhouse. Cutting down trees- that’s hard work. I’m starving,” he said. He kicked off his sandals and reached in the back seat for a duffle bag.</p>
<p>“But, your accent… I mean… you speak English… I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Sang-Tua was unbuttoning his suit jacket now as he said, “sure I do. I was born and raised in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>He unzipped the duffle bag and pulled out a pair of blue jeans, a nice shirt and a pair of sneakers.</p>
<p>I said, “Wait, so the crazy clothes, the accent, everything… that’s just an act?”</p>
<p>He shot me a look that might have been disappointment, “if you’re going to engage in illegal activity in broad daylight, it helps to be foreign and crazy.”</p>
<p>I contemplated this for a moment and then started the car. “The best burger joint on the east coast is about 70 minutes away,” I said. “Are you up for an adventure?”</p>
<p>Of course he was.</p>

<h3 id="part-i">Part I</h3>
<p>Originally <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aprrn/reddit_tell_me_about_the_absolute_hands_down/c0is86j/?context=4">posted on reddit</a></p>
<p>I'll never forget that Wednesday. I had been invited down to the PILT cosmic ray observatory. I don't know if you've ever heard of this thing, but it's essentially just a cave buried deep in the earth. You go down this long shaft until you arrive in an observation room.</p>
<p>The observation room looks out over the detection room. The detection room is surrounded on all sides by massive tanks of fluid. The whole setup is designed to block out all sorts of different types of background radiation that are passing through us all the time.</p>
<p>I had been invited down by a former coworker. This guy worked with me in neuroimaging for a while, until he found a job as a tech working for the PILT lab. I had called him to ask if he knew of any openings at his new job, and when he told me what he was doing I casually mentioned that I'd love to see the lab. He said 'sure', so here I was.</p>
<p>In the morning as I drove to the PILT site, I was listening to the local NPR station. They were talking about the unidentified object that was supposed to be passing by us in space today. I was surprised I hadn’t heard about it earlier. What surprised me more was the discussion they were having about it.</p>
<p>The original report aired, and then the reporter joined the anchor in the studio. The anchorman said, “Now, I understand there have been developments in this story today, Christine?”</p>
<p>Christine said, “Absolutely, Don. A spokesperson from NASA released a statement less than an hour ago reporting that the object seems to be slowing down.”</p>
<p>I glared at the radio, wondering if I’d heard that correctly. The anchor must have had the same reaction. He said, “I’m sorry Christine, did you say slowing down? In space?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Don,” said Christine. “NASA said they’d be making a statement about it shortly, but they said that at the moment, they aren’t ready to offer an explanation.”</p>
<p>Don said, “So, are they suggesting that this may be a manmade object after all then?”</p>
<p>Christine said, “They haven’t said that yet, Don. My understanding is that they’ve been tracking this object from some distance away from Earth.”</p>
<p>I set my mind to the task of imagining what kind of object could slow its own velocity in the vacuum of space. I thought of a giant mountain of ice and rock in space, and how the sun’s rays may melt and explode the ice on one side- causing some sort of steam geyser to act as a breaking rocket.</p>
<p>It seemed somewhat ridiculous, but not impossible. Maybe such a thing could slow down an asteroid just a little bit. Maybe that small drop in speed was all that NASA would need to sensationalize the event, and briefly catch the public imagination. They’d sensationalized their headlines for years, hadn’t they?</p>
<p>When I arrived at PILT, I met my friend, Chen. Chen was his last name, but I’d been calling him by it for so long that I’d forgotten his first name. “Chen, buddy!” I said, warmly, “Great to see you, man!”</p>
<p>Chen, shook my hand and we shared a tastefully brief guy-hug. That didn’t stop him from saying, “don’t grab my ass or anything. I know about you.”</p>
<p>Ah, good old Chen. “You know I’ve always wanted you,” I said.</p>
<p>“You complete me,” he said, with perfect deadpan. He used to say that to me all the time when we worked together at the hospital. It still made me chuckle.</p>
<p>He brought me into the PILT through a side entrance. The hallways were industrial and ugly. No big surprise- most research facilities didn’t waste time on comfort or esthetics.</p>
<p>Chen stopped at a few offices on the way down the long corridor. He introduced me to his various colleagues, and tastefully tried to sell them on my credentials. For the first time, I started to feel that I might actually get a job offer out of this visit.</p>
<p>Eventually we came to an employee lounge. A small crowd had gathered around a small television. On the screen there was a press conference. I didn’t recognize the speaker, but text on the screen told me that it was a NASA official. As we approached, the crowd hushed Chen and me.</p>
<p>I squeezed in next to the employees and listened with interest, catching the speaker mid-sentence: "-for about an hour. Our readings have been confirmed independently, and at this time, we calculate that the object will reach Earth in approximately three hours.</p>
<p>"We have no reason to expect a collision at this time, but we are concerned by the course change. There is very little doubt at this time that the object we call U-1373 is in fact being directed by some intelligence.</p>
<p>"We are contacting all space-faring nations and private corporations that may have any knowledge of this object, but due to its size and initial trajectory; it is unlikely that it is of Earth origin.</p>
<p>“I wish I could give you more details, but until it get’s a little closer, I’m afraid we don’t know much more. I’ll take some questions now, but I ask you wait until I call on you….”</p>
<p>The press conference erupted into questions, but no more information could be garnered. The employees in the lounge looked at each other with shocked eyes. Chen said, “Whoa… that is deep stuff.”</p>
<p>A pretty brunette in her mid-thirties spun around and said, “Aaron,” I want to see if we can take a look at that thing. She noticed me and gave a quizzical look. On another day she might have inquired who I was and what I was doing here, but in light of the circumstances, she didn’t care.</p>
<p>Chen said, “Okay, do we know where to look?”</p>
<p>From an office just out of view, someone answered, “I’m calling my guy over there right now. I’ll have it for you by the time you get down.”</p>
<p>Chen and the brunette started walking away. Chen didn’t stop as he called over his shoulder, “You coming, slow poke?”</p>
<p>Happy with the invitation, I jogged down the hall to catch up to them. We got to an elevator where Chen swiped his badge. The doors opened to reveal a surprisingly un-sturdy looking cage. The other two got in quickly. I hesitated for only a moment and stepped in, feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>The doors closed behind me, and I looked down at the grate we were standing on. Below I could see nothing but an infinite blackness. If Chen was bothered by the bottomless pit, he certainly didn’t show it. “Neat, huh?” was all he said.</p>
<p>The elevator jerked to life. Now, with a slow-descent in front of us, the brunette turned to Chen and said, “So, who is this now?”</p>
<p>Chen said, “This is my old co-worker, Kyle. I’m showing him around today. If we’re lucky, maybe we’ll get him to work for us.”</p>
<p>The woman shook my hand and said, “Well then, Kyle. You picked an interesting day to see what we do. I’m Karen, by the way.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Karen is the head boss-lady.”</p>
<p>“Assistant head boss-lady,” she corrected.</p>
<p>The elevator moved a fairly quickly, I thought, but it was hard to gauge the speed. There was nothing but darkness below and above us, and only a couple of tiny bulbs illuminated the lift itself.</p>
<p>The descent took nearly half an hour, and I found my ears popping many times. The pressure change made me feel rather uncomfortable, and I found myself wondering if you could get the bends from such a trip, or if that could only happen while SCUBA diving.</p>
<p>I thought we would pass the time by speculating on the mysterious object floating out to meet the Earth, but almost immediately Chen and Karen were discussing the technical details involved in repositioning their sensor array. I understood very little of what they were saying, and stood mute in the corner of the lift.</p>
<p>When we did eventually come to a stop, I was pleased to discover a rather nicer room than I’d been expecting. There were some comfortable chairs, some fantastic looking computer equipment, and the room actually had a cozy feeling about it. I noted with relief that there was a restroom down here, though I couldn’t imagine how the plumbing might work.</p>
<p>The room had been empty before we arrived. I wondered how often people actually came down here. Then I wondered why this wasn’t all done by remote up top. Chen sat down at the computer and shortly announced, “Abe sent me some coordinates.”</p>
<p>Karen was busy at a different terminal, but nothing on her screen made even the slightest bit of sense to me. Chen got up and went to a coat rack in the corner. He reached for something that at first glance I had thought was a lab coat. When he stepped into it, though, I realized it was some sort of full-body suit.</p>
<p>Chen saw my confusion and said, “Static suit. So I don’t damage the equipment.”</p>
<p>I nodded, without really understanding.</p>
<p>Chen opened a door that had been obscured by computer equipment, I saw him pull some sort of tether from a hook on the wall. He latched the tether to his suit and stepped into the other room, closing the door behind him. Through a long, narrow window on the wall, which I had at first confused for a florescent light, I saw Chen moving against a bright white background.</p>
<p>I moved to the window, and got my first glimpse of the PILT. One of the most expensive pieces of sensory equipment ever created. I turned to Karen and said, "Hey, wait a minute. How on Earth are we going to detect an object in space? Isn’t this whole place designed to block out everything but cosmic rays? Isn’t that the whole point of being this far underground?</p>
<p>Karen looked at me with surprise. “You mean Aaron didn’t tell you?”</p>
<p>That was the second time she’d said Aaron. It finally clicked that she was talking about Chen. How the hell had I forgotten his first name so completely? I shook my head at Karen, “Didn’t tell me what?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I’ll tell you if you swear to sign a non-disclosure agreement before you leave.”</p>
<p>Now I was intrigued. “Yeah, no problem,” I said.</p>
<p>Karen stepped over to me by the window and pointed at a strange square-shaped detector array which Chen was adjusting somehow. “You see that?” she said, “That is the first deep space quantum detection telescope.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” I said. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that.”</p>
<p>“Good,” she said. She didn’t seem interested in explaining it. She went back to her terminal.</p>
<p>I watched Chen work for another few minutes before he came back and shed his static suit. He sat down at the work station and brought up a rather bare-bones looking controller application. I saw him punch in the coordinates that he’d been sent, and then a status bar appeared indicating that something was charging.</p>
<p>In a moment, a green button labeled “detect series” appeared in the corner of the application. He looked at Karen and said, “We are ready.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I’m not,” and she continued her mysterious work.</p>
<p>I looked at Chen questioningly. He said, “I just reset the array and pointed it where we want to look. She is calibrating it to look at a closer distance.”</p>
<p>“You mean, she’s focusing it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Chen, “That would be a simpler way to say that.”</p>
<p>“She’s done,” said Karen.</p>
<p>“Fire one,” said Chen, and he clicked the green button.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. No sound, no flash, nothing- I looked at Chen for an explanation. He just said, “Give it a minute.”</p>
<p>So we waited and eventually something did appear on the screen. It was a series of images lined up like an array of tiny slides. Chen clicked on one to enlarge it. I didn’t see anything but a giant black square with some freckles of light here and there. I was disappointed.</p>
<p>Chen and Karen looked through some of the other slides and then Chen said, “Okay, that was a dud.”</p>
<p>He picked up a phone and dialed. On the other end I heard a muffled voice speak a muffled greeting. Chen, with his old familiar charm said, “You are an idiot.”</p>
<p>Then Chen laughed and said, “But seriously though, those coordinates didn’t work.”</p>
<p>The voice on the line said something, and Chen said, “Okay, bye.”</p>
<p>After hanging up, Chen explained that the object had changed course yet again, but that there was now a live coordinate feed coming from some radio telescope farm that I’d never heard of. Then, with surprising technical grace, Chen set up the PILT to track the object directly from the remote feed. He went over and showed Karen how to use the same feed to help focus the sensor array.</p>
<p>After all was set, Chen clicked the “detect series” button again. This time the array picked up something amazing.</p>
<p>Chen clicked on one of the slides and it enlarged to breathtaking detail. It was a sharp, arrowhead shaped object. Its surface had fine indented grooves on it, but I couldn't guess what purpose they served.</p>
<p>“This is the space object?” I said.</p>
<p>Chen nodded.</p>
<p>“How big is this?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Chen clicked a button and a grid overlaid the image. I didn’t see any scale associated with the grid, but Chen had all the information he needed.”900 meters long," he said. “500 meters wide at the fat part.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Wow… this thing is close. Can we see it’s trajectory?”</p>
<p>Chen looked at here blankly, and said, “What do you think this is? Star Trek? I have a computer that does <em>one thing</em> it aims a telescope. Next you’ll be asking me to raise shields and fire at it.”</p>
<p>Karen looked at him coldly, but he broke her indignation with his charismatic laugh.</p>
<p>I said, “Well, if you’ve got a high speed internet connection down here, we could probably get some streaming live news in here. Someone must have a graphic up by now showing us where that thing is headed.”</p>
<p>Chen pulled up a browser and in moments had CNN video displayed on the screen, but with no sound. He played around with the volume controls for a moment, but nothing happened. “I don’t think we get sound on these,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised,” I said. “A lot companies never install the audio drivers when they set up linux systems in a work environment.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s stupid,” he said. I just shrugged.</p>
<hr />
<p>We got our news from the print stories that came in bit by bit. On first glance we were bombarded by hundreds of headlines about a UFO coming towards Earth. There was speculation about a secret Chinese space project. There were blurry versions of the images we’d seen clearly on our screen moment’s ago. I started to get a sense for how amazing this PILT detector really was.</p>
<p>“We should send these out to someone,” said Chen, referring back to his slides. Karen agreed, and they sent a bunch to someone Karen knew at NASA. She cc’ed almost everyone in the PILT research center above us.</p>
<p>Within minutes Chen was receiving replies in his inbox. People were amazed by the images. Speculation ran rampant. Had I just witnessed the first clear images ever taken of a verifiable alien spacecraft? It sounded ridiculous, but I couldn’t think of any other explanation.</p>
<p>CNN was showing a graphic depicting a triangle and a circle around the Earth- it was clear they were trying to show an orbital pattern. I said, “I wish we had sound. Do you think they’re actually getting data to suggest it’s going to orbit when it gets here, or is this pure speculation?”</p>
<p>Karen and Chen just shrugged. We all had questions and no answers.</p>
<p>Then Chen refreshed the browser to get the latest headlines. We were bombarded by 15 variations on the proclamation: “ALIENS ORBIT THE EARTH!”</p>
<p>We clicked on a link from Reuters- and indeed, the article was written in present tense. The object <em>was</em> orbiting the Earth.</p>
<p>Chen said, “didn’t they say it was hours away?”</p>
<p>I nodded, “I thought I heard that as well.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Yes I’m certain they said three hours right before we came down here.”</p>
<p>And then, everything went dark.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” I said.</p>
<p>In the dark, Chen’s voice said, “Relax.”</p>
<p>As the words were leaving his lips I heard a loud click from another room and then a humming sound. The lights came back on. Soon after, the computer monitors clicked to life as well. I was surprised to see that, though the monitors had lost power, someone had had the sense to keep the computers themselves hooked up to a UPS. As the screens glowed back to life, everything was exactly as it had been.</p>
<p>Karen said, “We should leave. The backup generator will be enough to get us back up in the lift.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” asked Chen, “I really don’t want to get halfway up and find out we ran out of juice.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Yes, I’m sure. This is exactly what the generator was designed for in the first place.”</p>
<p>Chen looked skeptical and said, “I’m going to call upstairs just so they know to come get us if we’re not back in an hour.”</p>
<p>“I like that idea,” I said.</p>
<p>Karen nodded, and Chen picked up the phone. He pressed some buttons and then replaced the receiver. “No dial tone,” he said.</p>
<p>He typed out an email to someone upstairs, but he got a ‘timeout’ error when he tried to send it. I pulled out my cell phone, but before I could realize how futile that was; they were already shaking their heads at me.</p>
<p>Karen said, “They already know we’re down here. I think we should head on up. They’ll figure it out if we don’t show up in an hour or so anyway. The worst thing we can do is wait for the generator to die, then we might really be in trouble.”</p>
<p>I didn’t really follow her logic, but frankly I was getting a little claustrophobic, and besides, I wanted to be up there with the rest of humanity if today was going to be the big day when we finally meet an alien species.</p>
<p>We stepped into the lift. Karen pressed a button. The lift doors closed, but nothing happened. Karen pressed the button again. We stood under the small elevator lights under a pillar of dark, empty shaft. I took a slow breath, trying to stave off the early signs of a panic attack.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Karen, “This isn’t going to do at all.”</p>
<p>She pressed the DOOR OPEN button, to my relief, the doors obeyed. We stepped back into the cozy underground room.</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn’t really start to worry until several more hours had gone by. With the power outage, we’d lost our internet connection- so we were cut off from the news during the most exciting day in all of human history. It was infuriating. I allowed myself to stew on that for a while, because I knew that anger was better than fear.</p>
<p>Chen tried the phone every ten minutes or so. There was no dial tone.</p>
<p>Something occurred to me suddenly, and I went into the elevator and found an emergency phone that no one had noticed! I felt very proud of myself for a minute as I picked it up and I heard it start to ring.</p>
<p>My enthusiasm wore off, when after 5 minutes of ringing, I realized that no one was going to pick up. I walked out of the elevator again and sat down disappointed. “Well,” I said, “I think we’re really and truly stuck down here.”</p>
<p>Chen tried his phone again. No dial tone.</p>
<p>Karen had taken off her uncomfortable shoes, and I followed suit. “Well,” I said, “If we’re stuck down here for a while, at least we’ll lose some weight, right? So that’s something.”</p>
<p>Chen looked at me quizzically for a moment and then said, “Oh, are you hungry?”</p>
<p>I said, “A little, but we could be down here for a while, so if you have any food we should probably save it.”</p>
<p>Chen and Karen smiled at each other. Chen stood up. “Come with me, little friend,” he said. Then he opened up a door that I thought had led to the restroom.</p>
<p>Instead, there was a small room, and though the restroom lay beyond, there was yet another door off to the side. It was when Chen opened <em>this</em> door that my spirits were lifted.</p>
<p>The room we stepped into was fairly large. In the corner was a large generator humming away. Along the walls and on several shelves that jutted into the room, there were boxes of food and jugs of water. They even had a rather impressive medical station including a portable defibrillator.</p>
<p>Chen spotted something in the corner and said, “oh yeah!”</p>
<p>I watched him stroll over pull out some small bags with draw strings. He tossed one to me. I caught it and read the writing: ‘Ultra-Compact Sleeping Bag’. I had mixed emotions. I was glad for the comfort, but I had not yet resigned myself to spending the night in this hole in the ground.</p>
<p>Chen handed me a box of food and picked up a large jug of water. We walked back to where Karen was sitting, and Chen handed her a sleeping bag. She smiled and said, “Oh, fantastic!”</p>
<p>I pulled some packaged foods from the box Chen had handed me. It reminded me of the meals I used to pack when I went backpacking in the woods. They ended up tasting about the same as well, and I was grateful for the nourishment.</p>
<hr />
<p>None of us slept that night. We shared intimate stories, and speculated about the aliens above. Every so often we would try the phones, and the computers. With no sunlight to cue my circadian rhythms I spent the next 24 hours in a haze.</p>
<p>We’d been down in the detector lab for quite some time before I really started to freak out. I let the elevator phone ring for an hour before hanging it up. The internet and the regular phone system showed no signs of improvement. I started opening some filing cabinets and looking through PILT documents just to keep my mind occupied.</p>
<p>Karen said, “Find anything interesting?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. She said, “Yeah, I’m not surprised, those technical manuals are pretty dry. When we get out of here remember to have me send down some juicy mystery novels.”</p>
<p>I smiled politely, but I was starting to lose my patience. I was angry at the situation, and it was taking a lot of self control to avoid blaming Karen and Chen. They were victims here too, but part of me wanted to strangle them for getting us trapped down here.</p>
<p>We found a deck of cards in one of the storage boxes, and we busied ourselves playing every game we could think of. This went on for hours. Eventually we tired of it and tried to amuse ourselves in other ways. I searched through the computer hard drives for anything interesting and found nothing- not even a game of solitaire.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen engaged themselves with yet another game of War when I declined to play go-fish.</p>
<p>I returned to the filing cabinet and pulled out more folders. Something extraordinarily lucky happened then. As I was examining a rather bland manila folder I found a document labeled ‘EMERGENCY PROCEDURES’. After thumbing through for just a moment, I realized that I had struck gold.</p>
<p>“Hey! You two! Look at this!” I shouted at them. They looked me curiously as I brought the document over.</p>
<p>“Oh good,” said Chen. But he seemed unimpressed.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, “look at <em>this</em>.”</p>
<p>I pointed to a table of contents- a sectional labeled ‘ELEVATOR FAILURE / MANUAL LIFT CONTROLS’. They stopped playing cards and read with me.</p>
<p>The instructions were complicated, but nothing we couldn’t handle. Attached to the side of the lift was a mechanical hand crank. The hand crank needed to be removed from its storage location, then fastened to the cables after removing a protective panel. It took us about 45 minutes to work out the mechanics of it, but then we were good to go.</p>
<p>The emergency manual didn’t give any hints, but we estimated that it would take easily 6 hours to hand power the lift to the top of the shaft. We considered how much food and water we should bring- if any. And we decided that a day’s ration of food would do fine, along with plenty of water, which we were sure we would be sweating out.</p>
<p>We all relieved ourselves in the restroom. It had turned out to be a flush toilet, to my great shock. I tried not to think too terribly hard about where all the waste went to- it certainly wasn’t being pump all the way back up… was it?</p>
<p>All three of us took a half-dose of immodium to prevent any … unpleasantness in our long assent to the surface. We tried the phone and the internet one last time before climbing into the elevator and closing the doors behind us.</p>
<hr />
<p>The hand-crank mechanism was designed for use by one person, but we quickly found a method that allowed two of us to work while one rested. In this manner we worked in half-hour shifts, with a rotation every 15 minutes. Our assent was slow- much slower than we had hoped.</p>
<p>I noticed depth markers on some of the beams that framed the shaft, and assuming that we were aiming for a depth of ‘0’, I estimated that we would arrive in 8 hours, if we worked constantly. After 3 hours we found that in fact, we could not work constantly. We took long breaks, resigned to the idea that it would take us quite some time to complete the journey.</p>
<p>At 6 hours we all took a long break to have a substantial meal, and to rest our aching muscles. At 7 hours we passed the halfway mark. At 11 hours we took a vote and decided to take a sleep.</p>
<p>I sat, in the dim lift light, looking at the perfect blackness above and below. I was beyond feeling claustrophobic, nor was I any longer bothered by the height. All I felt was small. Incredibly small, like an ant digging out from the Earth.</p>
<p>I looked at the shaft supports wondering how long it had taken to construct this amazing tunnel. I noticed a line of ants walking on the beam... then on closer inspection I noticed that the ants weren't walking at all. They were all dead, in a perfect little line. It made me sad somehow.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen slept. I could not. My mind was troubled.</p>
<p>I could understand how we might have been forgotten about in all the excitement. I could understand how the building might have been deserted as people took the day off to be with their families as the aliens arrived. I could understand how an emergency lift phone might be ringing in an empty hall with no one to hear it.</p>
<p>What I couldn't understand is why we had lost power when we did, and why it hadn't come back. And why hadn’t the lift controls worked? As I had read the emergency manual earlier, I noticed that the hand crank was designed only for the case the backup generator had failed. It should have provided power to the lift computer at the top of the shaft.</p>
<p>As we rested only hours from the surface, I began to wonder what exactly was waiting for us. I wondered if it was something we really wanted to see.</p>
<p>I had lost all track of time. My entire body ached. We had reached and then passed the ‘0’ elevation marker an hour ago. The dark shaft was playing games with my head. I was starting to wonder if I was stuck in some real life Twilight Zone where I was eternally trapped- cranking this elevator for all time, like Sisyphus pushing his boulder up a hill.</p>
<p>Karen and I were sharing the work when it happened. In a hypnotic daze we were turning the crank. I had stopped counting the numbers on the beams. My eyes were half shut. And suddenly-</p>
<p><strong>-CLANK-</strong></p>
<p>The elevator shook and reverberated. We looked around and then Chen saw the top of the door. We had overshot it by a couple of feet. We briefly debated setting the hand crank in reverse and lowering ourselves, but we thought the better of it when Karen asked if such a maneuver might end up plunging us into a freefall.</p>
<p>We pried the doors open with considerable effort. Our poor leverage didn’t make the task any easier. After crying out for help, and receiving none we decided to make our escape.</p>
<p>I slid out first, which was terrifying. The lift was about three and a half feet above where it ought to be, so as I slid down, I felt that at any moment I might slip into the shaft below the lift. I was able to find my footing, though, and at last I was on solid ground.</p>
<p>I stepped back from the elevator doors looked down the dark hallways. I walked a few feet to wall and felt for a switch. I found one, but it did nothing. If the upstairs had a generator, it wasn’t working.</p>
<p>I walked back to the lift and helped the others down. We pulled the elevator doors shut carefully, and examined our surroundings.</p>
<p>One end of the hallway was pitch-black… the other end showed signs of sunlight around the corner. I headed towards the light, instinctively, but Chen grabbed my arm. “This way,” he said- and the three of us marched into the dark.</p>
<p>I heard Karen trip on something. Chen asked if she was okay, and she didn’t respond. Chen asked again, and we heard Karen scream.</p>
<p>My blood went cold, and I shouted “What?! What?!”</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” said Karen, “there’s a dead person on the floor right here.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Okay, let’s just be calm and get to the exit. I’ll go first. Why don’t you hold my hand?”</p>
<p>Karen agreed, and then I felt her grip my hand as well. I’m not ashamed to say I felt relieved.</p>
<p>The three of us marched farther into the darkness. Chen announced another body ahead, and then we walked around it. Eventually we got to the side exit, and Chen pushed it open.</p>
<p>The daylight was blinding. We all stood just outside the doors and gave our eyes time to adjust. When I could see again, the first thing I noticed was the birds.</p>
<p>There was a dead one in the parking lot, and another a dozen yards away. I saw two on the street.</p>
<p>“The air smells funny,” said Karen. I agreed. It smelled… stale somehow.</p>
<p>We walked to Karen’s car as it was parked the closest. Karen stopped us when she realized her keys were in her office inside. None of us were keen on the idea of going back in just yet, so we walked to my car instead.</p>
<p>I fished the keys out of my pocket, but the car wouldn’t respond to my remote. I put the key in the door and opened it. I tried to unlock the doors but the button didn’t work. It seemed like the battery was dead. I put the key in the ignition and turned it. There was a clicking noise. The battery was okay, but the engine wasn't turning over. I didn't know how to proceed.</p>
<p>We walked to Chen’s car. It was a rusty old pickup truck. I’d teased him about it when we worked together years ago. I couldn’t believe he still had it. He climbed into the driver’s side, and we heard the engine turn over. <em>Why his and not mine?</em> I wondered.</p>
<p>Karen and I squeezed into the cab, and Chen took off down the road. Along the way I saw more dead birds, here and there a dead squirrel, and then we started to see the car accidents. It started with an SUV spun off into a ditch. We investigated and found the driver quite dead.</p>
<p>We drove past two more car wrecks without stopping. I saw an entire field full of dead birds. I looked into the sky. I didn’t see anything but clouds and sky. “Stop the car,” I said.</p>
<p>Chen stopped the car, and then on request, the engine. I stepped outside and shut my eyes. Karen and Chen followed me. “What is it,” Karen asked.</p>
<p>“Shhh…” I said, “Listen.”</p>
<p>They were quiet. I was quiet. We heard nothing: not a bird, not a cricket, nor an airplane or a car; just the wind in the leaves and the sound of our own breathing.</p>
<p>We got back into the car and drove into town. Dead bodies were everywhere. Cars were driven into lamp posts and store fronts.</p>
<p>Karen said, “I think they all died at the same time, out of the blue. No one moved off the sidewalks to examine the car wrecks. People seem to have fallen in the middle of whatever they were doing.”</p>
<p>I looked at the small park in the town square. The leaves on the trees were green but falling off in significant numbers. It was bizarre- far too early in the season. I pointed to it and said, “Something is wrong with the plants, too.”</p>
<p>Then I smelled the air again. That’s when I knew. It hadn’t seemed possible, but I knew right then, that everything was even worse than it seemed.</p>
<p>“I don’t smell the bodies,” I said. I walked over to one and turned it over. It was a young girl. She looked as if she had died only moments ago- except for the telltale signs of internal pooling blood. “They aren't rotting.”</p>
<p>Chen and Karen looked at me, not understanding.</p>
<p>“This whole place has been sterilized,” I said. “It isn’t just the people and the animals. It’s the plants, and the microbes and the bacteria. Nothing is decomposing.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Do you think it’s like this everywhere?”</p>
<p>I nodded. But Chen said, “We can’t know that. We can’t possibly know that.”</p>
<p>I said, “I think someone is coming here to take our planet and set up their own ecosystem. They needed us out of the way so that we didn’t contaminate it. I think they just undid billions of years of evolution. No extinction in history has come close to this.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “We don’t know that yet. We should keep going.”</p>
<p>We got in the truck and drove into the night.</p>
<p>The sky was bright and beautiful without any city lights. But I didn’t look out the window. I knew there was nothing left to see.</p>
<h3 id="part-ii">Part II</h3>
<p>Although we never actually discussed it, it seems that we had decided to stick together. Chen, Karen and I drove from one dead town to another, to another. We noticed that Chen’s gas tank was looking a little low, and we realized it was time to come up with a plan.</p>
<p>Karen suggested that we find a new vehicle. I suggested that we find some sort of hand pump to siphon gasoline when we needed to. Not my idea, mind you- we all saw Will Smith do it in “I Am Legend”. Chen wanted to find a portable television or radio. The one in his car wasn’t working.</p>
<p>Our first stop was at a hardware store where we had planned to “load up on supplies.” But when we got there we realized that we had no idea what supplies it was that we were going to need. We picked up some flashlights so that we felt we had accomplished something. I looked for a fuel pump and couldn’t find one.</p>
<p>We went to an electronics store nearby. And although we had found that batteries worked just fine, we couldn’t get any of the radios or portable televisions to work. The evidence was stacking up that anything with a computer chip in it was pretty much useless.</p>
<p>Finding a vehicle was tough. Most modern cars had at least some computer controls in them. We looked in the used vehicle lots an eventually found a Cadillac that suited our needs. It wasn’t great, but it had nearly a full tank of gas, and it was comfortable.</p>
<p>We stopped into a grocery store and loaded up on produce after deciding that they were still safe to eat. It was disturbing to step around the bodies that had fallen in the store. There weren’t many of course. Most people had been huddled around their TVs when it happened.</p>
<p>I walked past the butcher’s shop and look at the steaks, thinking what a shame it was that there was no backup generator keeping them cool. I walked down several aisles before a thought struck me, and I ran back to meat department. I grabbed several of the tastier looking steaks and with my arms full walked back to join Karen and Chen at the cart.</p>
<p>Chen said, “Those have been sitting out at room temperature for a couple days, man. They’ll make us sick.”</p>
<p>“Will they?” I said.</p>
<p>Chen wasn’t getting it. I said, “That meat isn’t rotting, for the same reason these bodies aren’t decomposing.”</p>
<p>“The only microbes and bacteria in this store are the ones on our bodies,” I said. “As long as we don’t stay in any one grocery store for too long after we’ve contaminated it, we’ll have all the fresh meat a fish that we want.”</p>
<p>I had imagined a lot of post-apocalyptic scenarios in my day, but I had never dreamed of one where I would be eating steak well into my old age. This was bizarre.</p>
<p>We picked up matches, charcoal and bottled water. Karen and Chen started to stock up on canned foods until I reminded them that they didn’t have to worry about how the food was packaged. We could raid all the thawed frozen foods, or fresh foods that we wanted. None of it was going bad.</p>
<p>We walked out to the car that we had parked directly in front of the store, and I thought what a strange thing it was that parking laws were no longer a concern to us. We loaded the car, and again I noticed how eerily quiet the world had become. Getting into the back seat I said, “We really need to figure out where to get a hand pump.”</p>
<p>Karen ignored me and said, “You know who else must be alive? Coal miners. Some of them must have been underground at the time.”</p>
<p>Chen and I nodded. I said, “In the shaft, coming up… I saw dead ants well below the surface. I’m guessing the miners would have had to have been pretty deep to escape whatever this was.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “How would we find them?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I don’t know. Maybe we can find coal mines on maps somewhere?”</p>
<p>“What does it matter?” I asked.</p>
<p>Karen said, “Well, if there are people out there we should try to find them. Strength in numbers, and all.”</p>
<p>“Karen,” I said. “Don’t you understand? We’re extinct! The human race doesn’t get to bounce back from this! Our ecosystem is gone. Food can’t grow, plants can’t pollinate.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know that,” said Chen, “…about the food. Something might be able to grow.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “We should do an experiment. We should get some seeds and try to plant something.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I said. “The human race will still be dead. Even if we find a couple hundred miners still alive, it’s not enough to start repopulating the planet. And whatever did this is probably coming back- so we can pretty much just kiss our asses goodbye.”</p>
<p>Karen said nothing.</p>
<p>Chen said, “We still don’t know that this happened everywhere. Let’s just keep driving and see what we see.”</p>
<p>Chen had always been rather reserved when it came to showing genuine emotion. He was affectionate enough, but his gestures always had a tongue-in-cheek quality. I had rarely gotten him to speak about his private life, even back in the days when we shared an office together. That’s why I was surprised when he was the first of us to say, “So, I guess our families are dead.”</p>
<p>Neither Karen nor I looked at him, or even said anything. I’d been trying hard not to think about it. A long time passed when the only noise we heard was the rumbling of highway beneath the Cadillac tires. Eventually I said, “Don’t do that, Chen.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do what?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t stop being the optimist,” I said. “I assumed the world was dead because I couldn’t imagine that whatever did this would target our little corner of it. But we don’t actually <em>know</em> anything.”</p>
<p>My words sounded unconvincing in my ears, as Karen steered us around a pile of wrecked cars and continued down the long strip of gray highway. Chen might have found some comfort in them, though. That’s the advantage of being a life-long downer: when you say something upbeat, it tends to carry more weight than it otherwise might.</p>
<p>“We should figure out where we’re staying for the night,” Karen said.</p>
<p>Chen said, “Maybe we should figure out where we’re going while we’re at it.”</p>
<p>It was true. We’d just been driving west along the interstate for hours. We never really discussed a destination. I suppose we had all silently agreed to just drive as far as we could in a straight line to see if we would ever find ourselves outside of all this death.</p>
<p>“If we stop at a hotel we’ll find some clean beds,” said Chen. “And a lot of dead people.”</p>
<p>“All the sheets in the w-.. in the area- are completely sterile, I’m betting,” I reminded him. It was odd to realize how much of modern life was concerned with hygiene.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said. “Do you realize that if we spit out the window or shit in the woods, the bacteria that live in our bodies will have free reign to take over the entire wor-… area?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I like it better when you don’t talk.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Our fuel was running low, and we decided it was time to swap cars and look for a fuel pump again. We pulled into a tiny town and stopped in front of a hardware store. A dead man was lodge in the doorway.</p>
<p>I picked up his corpse, surprised by the weight of it. I was grateful that it didn’t smell bad. Oddly the only scent I noticed was his shampoo. It smelled like berries or something.</p>
<p>I dropped the body, harder than I’d intended to, and I was deciding whether or not to feel bad about it, when I heard Chen say, “<em>That</em> is our next car.”</p>
<p>I looked up to see what he was talking about. It was beautifully restored 1950’s… something or other… I was too far away to see a make or model, but I could see that it was a gorgeous automobile. “Looks good,” I said. “Why don’t you see which of these poor bastards has the key?”</p>
<p>Chen turned a little pale when I said that, but then he hustled over and began checking the pockets of the dead. I went into the hardware store and stepped over the body of an old man as I made my way to the automotive section. Again, no fuel pump.</p>
<p>For the millionth time that day I wished I could have the internet back- just for a minute. I would love to google ‘gasoline fuel pump’ and see if I could get an idea for where one might be.</p>
<p>I stepped out of the hardware store where Karen was stretching against the car. She was a beautiful woman, and during our time in trapped underground at the PILT I had allowed myself to fantasize about her. Up here, with death all around, I had put all thoughts of sexuality aside. Until now.</p>
<p>She caught me staring at her, and I quickly deflected my gaze. It landed on a sign across the street that read, “Hudson’s Hobbies.” An interesting idea hit me. “I’m going in there,” I said, indicating the store.</p>
<p>Karen nodded, and I dashed into the store. This one was much darker, but I had a flashlight in my pocket since our raid on the first hardware store. It didn’t take me long until I found what I was looking for: an amateur electronics kit. “1001 Projects” it said. Perfect.</p>
<p>As I was heading out the door I noticed some impressive remote control airplanes. I paused for a moment, thinking about how I’d always wanted to try one out- then I realized that I would have all the time in the world for frivolities later. As I let my flashlight swing back to the floor, something caught my eye. It didn’t register consciously, but my brain <em>knew</em> that it had seen something important.</p>
<p>I scanned my flashlight on the boxes beneath the airplanes. What was I looking for? And then I saw it. It was a small box labeled “HAND FUEL PUMP”. <em>Of course!</em> These large model airplanes ran on liquid fuel! Was it gasoline? It didn’t matter- the pump would work. I was sure of it. I grabbed three off the shelf.</p>
<p>I came outside just in time to see Chen pull up in our fancy new wheels. I showed my loot to Karen. “Whoa… nice,” she said to the fuel pumps, then, “Why the kit?”</p>
<p>“I thought me might build a simple radio receiver,”I said."</p>
<p>“Do you know how?” she asked.</p>
<p>I said, “No, but I’m pretty sure that all these kits let you build some sort of crystal radio.”</p>
<p>Chen honked the horn. It made a hilarious “Aa-oooo-ga” sound. “Are you guys getting in or what?” he said.</p>
<p>“Maybe we should move our supplies over to this car first,” I said.</p>
<p>Chen said, “Oh, yeah… let’s do that, then.”</p>
<p>It only took a couple of minutes to move the groceries over. I decided I had taken too much meat with us before.</p>
<p>“But it won’t go bad,” Karen said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “Now that we’ve touched it… I just don’t know how fast the germs on our skin are going spoil this stuff.”</p>
<p>“We should cook up some of that steak right now,” said Chen, “I’m pretty hungry.”</p>
<p>Karen and I agreed. I looked over at the hardware store and saw a large hibachi. “That’ll do.” I said.</p>
<p>We decided to cook and eat our food at a park bench in a small patch of green in the town. I’m pretty handy on the grill, so the meal was actually kind of nice. The steak tasted surprisingly normal. We did need to take a short break when we realized we had no plates or utensils. That, as with most of our material needs so far, was easily remedied.</p>
<p>After the meal, Karen wanted to use a restroom. I pointed out that every toilet with tank had one good flush in it. I think she found the revelation comforting.</p>
<p>“Showers will be the hard part,” Chen said to me when Karen had wandered off. “What are we going to do for hot water?”</p>
<p>“The way I see it,” I said, “we have some options. We can go to camping supply store and get a solar shower- just a black bag that holds water and get heat from direct sunlight, <em>or</em> we can grab ourselves a generator and find a way to hook it up to a hot water heater.”</p>
<p>“But what about the water?” asked Chen, “how long are these places going to have water pressure?”</p>
<p>“That’s not a big problem,” I said, “We just need to find a house with a well.”</p>
<p>“Besides, these towns will probably have water pressure for…” my voice trailed off and I felt the blood drain out of my face.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Chen asked.</p>
<p>“We could be in big trouble,” I said.</p>
<p>Chen looked around at the dead streets littered with corpses. “Bigger trouble than this?”</p>
<p>“No, not bigger trouble,” I corrected myself, “just- more immediate. I thought we would have more time, but of course we don’t.”</p>
<p>“More time for what?” asked Chen.</p>
<p>I said, "Right now, all over the country, nuclear reactors are melting down. They were designed to operate without humans… maybe even shut down safely… but all of those safety procedures must have been handled by computers- computers that went dead at the same time as the people.</p>
<p>“There must be dozens or hundreds of Chernobyls happening all over the world right now! Giant clouds of radioactive fallout could be coming our way right now. For all we know we’re breathing it in right now.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “So what should we do?”</p>
<p>I shook my head, “I don’t know. I don’t know where the reactors are to avoid them, and I don’t know where to find a map to locate them. Most of all, I don’t know how their fallout will disperse.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Maybe we should get radiation suits and those radiation detector thingies.”</p>
<p>“Geiger counters,” I said.</p>
<p>“Where?” I said, shaking my head in resignation. Just one more thing that google isn’t around to help with.</p>
<p>Karen came back a minute later to see our sullen faces. “What now?” she asked.</p>
<p>“We’re all going to die,” said Chen, nodding his head to me.</p>
<p>“Oh, is that all?” said Karen. “You know, I’ve been thinking we should get some new clothes. You guys are starting to stink.”</p>
<p>Oh, the irony. We were standing in an ocean of corpses, and we were the smelly ones.</p>
<h3 id="part-iii">Part III</h3>
<p><strong>5 years later...</strong></p>
<p>I shot Chen in the face, so he called me a douchebag.</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” I said. “My skills are mighty mighty.”</p>
<p>He respawned a minute later and told me, “It’s on mother trucker.”</p>
<p>I was ready for him with a grenade. He died spectacularly.</p>
<p>“WEAK!” he announced, “So weak. That was a bitch move. You play like a little bitch.”</p>
<p>I laughed at him and was about to throw a little trash-talk back his way when Karen appeared at the door and said, “Are you two still at this?”</p>
<p>I took off my headset. “I could break for lunch,” I said.</p>
<p>I saw that Chen had disconnected from the game. “I thought we were running today?” he said.</p>
<p>I shut down the game and turned off my computer. The NORAD sticker had started to peel off the side. I smoothed it back down and smiled.</p>
<p>The computers had once been responsible for the defense of the nation, and now they were sitting in a Beverly Hills mansion and being used to play shoot-’em-up games. What a crooked little world this had become.</p>
<p>We hadn’t gone to NORAD to pick up the computers, of course. We had gone because it had occurred to Chen that anyone inside the Cheyenne Mountain stronghold may well have been protected from whatever it was that happened on the surface. When we’d arrived at the base it had been the biggest blow to our morale since the whole nightmare had begun.</p>
<p>It turns out that it’s surprisingly easy to access high security areas when all the military personnel have died spontaneously. We’d walked through the amazingly huge blast doors and down an immensely long corridor. We didn’t find a single locked door. We did find corpses, though. Everywhere- fresh corpses, unspoiled by decomposition.</p>
<p>Karen had cried then. It was one of the very few times that she let her guard down. We’d all been hoping so hard that we would find life inside the mountain. Chen and I fared better, but the depression hit Chen pretty hard in the weeks that followed.</p>
<p>We would have left NORAD empty-handed except that Karen had noticed something rather spectacular. She had turned over one of the corpses- a man in civilian clothing. She’d wanted to check for signs of decomposition. We’d hoped at least that microscopic life might have been spared. Of course it hadn’t. What she did find was a digital watch. A <em>working</em> digital watch.</p>
<p>Whatever had killed the life on our planet had penetrated deep, but whatever had destroyed the computer circuitry in the world outside had not been able to breach this fortress. In short order we raided every useful piece of technology we could find. The computers, monitors and routers had been a phenomenal find. We took some watches and a few laptops. Our favorite catch of the day was handheld two-way radios. The security personnel had several. We took them all, along with a couple of chargers.</p>
<p>We’d left NORAD feeling more lost than ever. We’d piled in the car and headed east. But that was long ago… It must have been- because I remember even then having a glimmer of hope that we might find someone alive somewhere. I haven’t felt that way for quite some time.</p>
<p>We’d spent a year travelling to every corner of North and South America. For months we debated about travelling across the Atlantic Ocean and seeing if there was life on the other continents. But all the modern boats we found- at least the ones big enough to handle a trek across the ocean- were all out of commission.</p>
<p>We had considered sailing across, but none of us had ever piloted a boat before, and we were certain that we would die or be lost at sea if we were to attempt the journey. We considered other forms of travel. Airplanes were out of the question, and we considered traveling up through Alaska and then taking the short journey over to Russia. We never actually ruled it out, but by the time we’d visited all the dead corners of our own hemisphere, we had stopped believing that life could be found anywhere.</p>
<p>Eventually we decided to take a break from our travels and settle someplace nice. We chose Beverly Hills for no reason in particular except that we knew we’d find some nice homes there. The house we settled on wasn’t owned by anyone we’d ever heard of- Harold … <em>something</em>- I’ve forgotten now.</p>
<p>We’d gotten rather adept at setting up generators and in our new house we set up solar panels as well. It was enough to run the computers and do a little LAN gaming. We even got Karen to play sometimes- though she preferred to read on her own.</p>
<p>We’d lived happily in our house for two years now: reading, playing, scavenging, and sometimes even planning for the future. We went running together on most days- trying to stay physically fit. Always looming over our heads was the knowledge that none of us had any real medical experience.</p>
<p>The good news is that we never seemed to get sick. Even when Chen got a nasty wound on his leg, and we sewed it up with regular clothing thread nothing more ever came of it. That was our small blessing. The sterile world was a safer one.</p>
<p>Karen cleared her throat, ripping me away from my recollections. “The computer will still be here when we get back,” she said.</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. “I’ve turned it off. I was just… thinking…”</p>
<p>“Well stop thinking and get ready for a run,” she said.</p>
<p>Chen was already clomping up the stairs to grab some sneakers. Karen followed after him, and I watched her go, admiring her toned body. In moments I heard giggling from upstairs and squeaking of bedsprings. I shook my head and tried to put it out of my mind.</p>
<p>The relationship between the three of us was strange one. Both Chen and I were intimate with Karen. It had started about a month after the disaster.</p>
<p>Chen had bedded her first, and of course I had known about it- though they had tried to be tastefully discreet. We’d been staying overnight in a large hotel and we’d all taken separate rooms on the second floor. At some point in the night they had left to some distant corner of the hotel. I hadn’t heard anything… but I knew.</p>
<p>My lust for Karen had grown over the weeks, and losing her to Chen had been painful. The fact that she was probably the last woman alive made the situation unbearable in the extreme. For the next couple days I didn’t say much to either of them.</p>
<p>On the third day, we were on a university campus, exploring for a Geiger counter and other supplies. We’d split up to cover more ground- and frankly because we enjoyed moments of privacy away from each other.</p>
<p>I remember that Karen had followed behind me when I went into what turned out to an administration building. Karen was standing there giving me a look that I couldn’t quite quantify. Jealousy and desire had been burning in my mind since she’d had her tryst with Chen. I was certain she was about to tell me about the two of them, and I was already trying to decide how I was going to take the news.</p>
<p>Instead of talking, she kissed me. It was slow and seductive. I didn’t understand what it would mean for all of us at the time, but I didn’t care. We found our way into an empty classroom, and I kicked the door shut behind us as she began to remove my shirt.</p>
<hr />
<p>It went on like that for some time. Karen would find me alone and attack me, or I would suddenly notice that she and Chen had gone missing together for a while. Once I understood Karen’s game, my feelings of jealousy and envy began to wane.</p>
<p>Chen and I only spoke of it once. I said, “I know about you and Karen.”</p>
<p>He didn’t look at me as he said, “I know about <em>you</em> and Karen.”</p>
<p>I nodded, and we never spoke another word about it.</p>
<p>And so we fell into a peculiar little pattern. Karen decided which on of us she wanted and when. She would pull us aside in private, often without saying a word. She handled her role admirably. Neither Chen nor I ever felt like rivals, nor did we feel neglected. It was a peculiar sort of compromise.</p>
<p>I only spoke to Karen about Chen once. She had come to my bedroom one night in our Beverly Hills mansion, and as we lay together in the dark, drifting into sleep she said, “I love you.”</p>
<p>“…and Chen?” I asked.</p>
<p>There was a long pause, and a quiet, “No.”</p>
<hr />
<p>So as I went to my room and took my time putting on some sweats and a T-shirt, laced my sneakers, began to stretch- I didn’t really mind that Chen and Karen were together in the other wing of the house. She was keeping us all sane, and all together.</p>
<h3 id="fanfic-by-little-kitty"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flossdaily/comments/as78s/sterile_fanfic_follows_on_from_sterile_part_iii/"><em>Fanfic</em>, by Little Kitty</a></h3>
<p>One of the things that we were always fighting against was going crazy. It was good that we had each other, but in a world filled with bodies and silence it’s hard to keep true to who you are. We don’t think of it day to day, but so much of our psyche is about dealing with our day-to-day interactions in an appropriate way, and when all the stimuli change the brain’s feedback loops have a tendency to behave unpredictably. We all found ourselves having childish tantrums about nothing at all and sitting staring into space. We’d expected this to subside given time, but after five years it was clear that it was now an unwanted side to who we were.</p>
<p>Karen was usually the first to spot the signs, and seemed to have a knack for knowing what to do to bring us round. Modern America was filled with distractions, from adverts to driving to money, but now that had all faded away. Bleached white billboards were everywhere, the roads were clear bar a few pile-ups and money was occasionally useful for the fireplace. We’d done the obvious things to have fun, from firing machine guns at army bases to driving around in go-carts downtown and through shopping malls; even a few outlandish things like ‘robbing’ a bank using shotguns and explosives.</p>
<p>This time though, it was Karen who was down. I’d catch her looking longingly at the horizon or with tears in her eyes when nothing had happened. We were familiar enough, and knew enough that we would share things rather than bottle them up, but she didn’t know what was wrong. When you have no distractions and no medical service it’s easy to become a hypochondriac, thoughts of brain cancer or similar could drive you mad if you let them, but the real problems for us seemed to be psychological. I found her leaning on the balcony, staring into the distance and went to talk to her while Chen was making lunch, the summer sun reflected brightly off her long, soft brunette hair. Cosmetics were yet another thing where now we only used the best, and Karen seemingly enjoyed the adventure of playing with them.</p>
<p>What did you like to do as a child? I asked her, snapping her out of the trance.</p>
<p>“As a child?” She pondered for a while, memories flitting across her face. “I guess I was a bit of a tomboy; I had science kits and electronics and I liked to be creative”</p>
<p>“Sounds more like a nerd” I said, fully aware that amongst the three of us she was clearly the least nerdy.</p>
<p>“Ooh, get you!” She exclaimed, “I suppose your favourite hobby was alphabetizing your pocket protectors”</p>
<p>I shot her a look of feigned outrage, and putting on my best country bumpkin voice said “why no, I was up at the crack of dawn milking the cows and rode horses in the mountains after school.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you were a country lad” said Karen, fixing me with her gaze and seizing upon something of a revelation about my otherwise academic background.</p>
<p>“Well my uncle owned the farm; it was where I went for the holidays”</p>
<p>“Ah, so you’re not such a cowboy after all then.” She paused for a moment, the thought of country life running through her mind. “I remember when my family camped by Turquoise Lake in Colorado, it was quiet there like it is here, but I was never afraid there.”</p>
<p>I thought about this for a moment, and it occurred to me that the familiarity of visiting there might do her some good. “Turquoise Lake you say, that’s where we’ll go then. We’ll leave this afternoon.”</p>
<p>It was an approach I had learned from Karen. When we looked to be going off the rails, she’d make a decision and tell us what we were going to do, the unspoken agreement was something that came naturally to us, perhaps some basic human instinct lay behind it, but either way once a plan had been decided upon that was it.</p>
<p>We were seasoned pros at road-tripping now, and had all the best gear that money could have bought if it were still a concern. Our tent, medical supplies, spare wheels, fuel and oil went in the trailer while the back of our full cab truck was filled with food and in-transit sleeping quarters for when we drove in shifts. The original owner had fitted a gun rack, we’d left in place along with the guns, but it was really just another way of dealing with the world, hoping against hope that there would be something or someone out there in spite of our years of fruitless searching.</p>
<p>The journey itself was uneventful by our standards. We’d become used to the gradual signs of decay from wind, sunshine and oxygen. It was slow, but incessant and unpleasant. We’d stop to drain petrol from vehicles, but we’d try very hard to look for vehicles without occupants. Five years inside an effective greenhouse had turned most of the bodies into husks, not dissimilar to Egyptian mummies, and the reminder of our own mortality was never pleasant.</p>
<p>Chen and I took the opportunity while Karen was asleep in the back to discuss the finer details of the plan. Details were always his thing, and caring for Karen like I did success in improving her state of mind was important to him.</p>
<p>“We should make it like she remembers it, camping, tales by the fireside, walks in the woods, that sort of thing” said Chen.</p>
<p>“You make it sound like reversion therapy” I replied.</p>
<p>“Maybe it is, maybe returning to a childlike state and learning how to live in this world is a stage we have to go through.”</p>
<p>“But this time without the fear of bears” I replied dryly. “The world’s changed.”</p>
<p>“Then we need to change too, adapt and survive”</p>
<p>“Survive” I said quietly, almost to myself.</p>
<p>“Yes Kyle, survive, but this is about more than that, this is about living and adapting and enjoying the world again. We all know surviving isn’t enough, that’s why we’re here.”</p>
<p>We arrived at Turquoise Lake in the early morning, and it was clear why Karen had remembered it. The mountains rose majestically in the background, the water, after years without disturbance or life was ridiculously clear. The surrounding evergreen trees seemed less affected by the years than the deciduous ones elsewhere which were now little more than standing firewood. Karen’s mood seemed lifted by the familiarity. She was running around like a small child, energised by a scene which to a casual observer was little changed from five years ago. Chen and I started making camp, but Karen was keen to go for a run before the summer sun made it uncomfortably hot.</p>
<hr />
<p>We donned our top of the range running shoes, along with our heavily customised t-shirts. Being the only survivors we knew of had eventually led to some rather black humour, so Chen had juxtaposed ‘world 100m champion’ alongside ‘world’s shortest man’. Karen had chosen ‘Olympic shot-put gold medallist and I had chosen my ‘World’s Strongest Man’ shirt.</p>
<p>“Ah, the world’s oldest man” remarked Chen as he stretched, “Do try to keep up.”</p>
<p>“Last one around is rotten egg” I shouted, setting off on the well signposted lakeside trail, leaving him with a few metres to catch up.</p>
<p>Running was one of the times we all felt free from life’s worries. Training together for years meant that we were very evenly matched for speed, so there was never a worry of leaving someone behind, but today was about enjoying the environment, breathing in the still pine scented air and watching the sun rise higher in the sky over the lake. It was truly a beautiful place, with small streams springing from the base of the mountains to feed the lake and snow still present on the peaks high above us. Leading the group while crossing a bridge over one of the streams I was suddenly aware of an odour I’d not smelt in years, an odour of decay. I snapped around and stopped, trying to catch the scent again. Chen and Karen gave me a weird look.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” asked Chen.</p>
<p>“Did you smell that?” I replied, “It smelt like decay!”</p>
<p>A confused look passed between them for a moment, but then they took paid more attention to their olfactory sense. It was subtle, but definitely real, and seemed to be stronger as we got closer to the stream. My mind started racing, the adrenaline heightening my senses. We searched around the streambed for the source of the smell, but no fungi seemed apparent.</p>
<p>“A biofilm!” Karen exclaimed. “Here on some dead leaves.”</p>
<p>Chen and I rushed over to see what she was talking about.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?” I asked. Karen seemed to be staring at nothing more than a wet pile of leaves.</p>
<p>“Look closely, or better yet, run your finger across it and feel the slime.” Karen ran he finger across an exposed leaf and showed us what looked like dirty hair gel on her finger. The smell was now much stronger.</p>
<p>“So what is it?” Chen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a collection of billions of bacteria, they produce a sticky polymer which binds them together and sticks them to a food source. It’s life.” replied Karen.</p>
<p>“But not as we know it Jim” I replied, the nerd in me showing in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>“Can’t tell” said Karen, “it looks terrestrial, but I’ll need a good microscope to be sure. Take some samples.”</p>
<p>We collected samples and headed back to the truck, formulating a plan as we went. There was the University of Denver less than fifty miles away, so we chose to go there. Our natural scientific curiosity was running at full speed and all melancholy thoughts were temporarily on hold as we reverted to what we had trained for years to do. Hypotheses sprang up like weeds in fertile ground.</p>
<p>Chen gave his upbeat opinion “I think a deep aquifer survived under the Rockies, and now years later those deep bacteria have surfaced in a world of opportunity. With food everywhere and no competition the selective pressure is huge to adapt, there must be genetic information from adapted bacteria in the same location, even if it’s dead, so given several years and all the above it’s just starting to take hold. Photosynthesis isn’t here yet, but give it a few decades and”</p>
<p>I interrupted “Photosynthesis arises from chloroplasts; they were originally thought to be endosymbiotic, so that’s a no go unless you’ve got surviving chloroplasts.”</p>
<p>Karen gave us a rather more fearful scenario, worry creeping into her voice “But what if it’s alien, the first phase of terraforming the planet so that they can colonise it, changing the atmosphere so”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll find out in the lab” I cut in. We had all experienced worries; dreams of alien fleets arriving filled with colonists, gigantic machines terraforming out atmosphere and seas until it was no longer Earth but something completely different. We had also learned to cut those thoughts short for the sake of our sanity. “I quite like the idea of persistent terrestrial life too. If they do come back to colonise then bam! They get infected in War of the Worlds style.”</p>
<p>“But what if that’s why they haven’t come yet, what if they’re testing to see what survives and they’ll launch a focused blast deep into the ground anywhere life remains?” Karen’s voice was getting panicked.</p>
<p>“Then we’ll be in a situation no worse than we are at the moment, and there’ll still be nothing we can do to change it” answered Chen. Karen mulled this truth over, accepted it and recognised her panic.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry guys, I’m just excited. I’m like this with all discoveries; I spot what might be wrong before I let myself enjoy it.” She sighed and relaxed. “What if it’s the same in the deep ocean, under miles of water, especially in the trenches? There’s advanced life down there, fish, crustaceans all sorts. Obviously the ecosystem will need to spread and adapt, but there’s going to be plenty of food on the way from everything that died, and it won’t take more than a few mutations for them to adapt to the depth change.” She stopped suddenly; a look of unease crossed her face. “But there’s still the issue of chloroplasts.”</p>
<p>“Life finds a way” I replied thinking of Jurassic Park. “Besides, all the genetic information will be there in one form or another, so given sufficient contact area between the rising ecosystem and dead algae it’ll just be a matter of time.”</p>
<p>It was clear that none of us were biologists, but even if we had been the situation presenting itself was one that would normally be passed over for being far too unlikely to occur. As scientists we enjoyed breaking new ground, but so much of this was unknown it was difficult to know where to begin</p>
<p>“Shame that we all missed out on terraforming 101 in the University of Alpha Centaurii” quipped Chen.</p>
<p>“Meh, I hear the accommodation’s awful and the food is worse” replied Karen, her mood finally lifted.</p>
<p>The conversation quieted down and I switched Karen’s iPhone on to play through the military radio we’d lifted from Cheyenne Mountain. It was the only piece of really modern technology we’d brought with us from the bottom of the mine, and having music really helped pass the time. We’d listen to vinyl discs sometimes when back in Beverly Hills, but out on the open road that didn’t really work as a technology, and anything more modern used so many integrated circuits that repair was out of the question.</p>
<p>The bright sunshine and lack of electrical power indoors in the biochemistry labs meant it was easier to bring the microscope outside. It would have been great to use an electron microscope, but with fried circuits everywhere that option wasn’t on the table. Karen grabbed some slides and began preparing samples while Chen and I wheeled the largest optical microscope on the ground floor out of the dark and dingy lab into the open.</p>
<p>We set the microscope to 500x and Karen studied the sample carefully. Chen and I waited patiently as she focused on the slime held between the thin glass slides. She moved the sample around, taking her time.</p>
<p>“Well it certainly could be terrestrial, but further study is necessary” she stated.</p>
<p>“Typical scientist, always after the next round of funding” I replied in an amicable tone, rolling my eyes.</p>
<p>“Seriously though, it could be, but there are all sorts of tests needed to identify the cell type, we’d want to compare the DNA to known samples, test the reaction to chemicals. All the things a biology student would do, so it’s a good thing we’re here with textbooks and reagents on hand.”</p>
<p>She had a point, and as scientists we all knew it. A world expert on subterranean bacteria would have the job done in ten minutes, but we were looking at a week or so of reading and testing before we could identify the cells.</p>
<p>I took a look through the microscope. A fleck of dead leaf sat on the left with a slimy looking collection of inactive cells positioned next to it. There wasn’t much to them with no staining to reveal the detail or chloroplasts to add colour. Could be terrestrial was as good as we were likely to manage today. I stepped away and Chen took over at the microscope.</p>
<p>“So this slime, assuming it’s terrestrial, why haven’t we seen it before?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We’ve been by the sea most of the time, it might be barely surviving here, not yet adapted to warmer or saline conditions” replied Karen. “We’re so used to the ubiquity of life that we can easily forget how many adaptations are required for each new environment just to survive, let alone thrive. Even the micro-organisms we’ve spread in our travels don’t appear to have taken root, they’re not self-contained ecosystems, so they run out of essential supplies. If these really are from a deep source then they have roots supplying them with much of what they need.”</p>
<p>Moving away from the microscope Chen rejoined the conversation “So now we set up camp here and become biology students?”</p>
<p>“We may as well” replied Karen. “It’s the only way we’ll find out the answer. It’s not like anyone else is going to do the work, and we need a goal.”</p>
<p>“Time to set up camp then I guess” walking back to the truck. “Should we look for a Hilton or Sheraton?” I asked “Lousy room service at both these days.” We piled back into the truck and began the usual debate about hotels.</p>
<hr />
<p>“What’s that light on the radio?” Asked Chen, suddenly giving the jerry rigged military kit affixed to our dashboard his full attention. A small amber light was slowly blinking on and off, one we’d never seen before, beneath it was a button labelled play. It wasn’t an advanced looking piece of kit, and we only used it for the aux-in connection to play music.</p>
<p>Butterflies took over my stomach as I reached for the play button, gently pressing it. A Russian voice came over the speakers, giving one short phrase.</p>
<p>“Shai-yenn poroznee” was all it said; or at least that was what we wrote down with none of us being conversant in Russian. It was tempting at first to grab an English-Russian dictionary from the University library, but we quickly realised that our spelling used the wrong alphabet, and even so was probably wrong. Our initial excitement at another human voice, even recorded, was dimming as quickly as the sunlight as evening approached.</p>
<p>“So how do we find out what it means?” I asked, putting the question on the table. To my mind this was like trying to solve a cryptic crossword in a new language.</p>
<p>“Could we could send a message back?” asked Chen.</p>
<p>“Not with this kit.” I replied indicating the dash mounted radio. It’s only good for a dozen miles or so and that sounded Russian. “We need something powerful, and it still has to work.”</p>
<p>“What about the kit at Cheyenne Mountain, that’s only 70 miles South of here” replied Karen.</p>
<p>“Cheyenne Mountain” I replied quickly and reached for the play button again.</p>
<p>“Shai-yenn poroznee” said the Russian voice again. A smile lit up our faces as the idea formed in our heads.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, we probably don’t have much time” I said grabbing the wheel and starting the truck. The tyres grabbed onto the hot dusty asphalt and we roared off. Chen fiddled with the radio to try to broadcast a signal, even if it was only some music and Karen clung on in the back as we sped around corners, keen to get there before whoever sent the message left.</p>
<p>“Good thing that there are no cops” I said, tearing down the I85 at well over 100 mph.</p>
<p>“Good thing too that everyone was off the road and watching TV” replied Chen, his efforts with the radio having amounted to nothing, largely down to wires we’d cut when rigging it up in the first place.</p>
<p>Arriving at the entrance we were relieved to see two military trucks parked, the headlights showing the fresh tyre marks clearly in the dust which covered most exposed flat surfaces these days.</p>
<p>Climbing out of the truck I said flatly “We’re in time. But what do we do?” Karen and Chen came to stand next to me and we collectively stared at the entrance. It was now nearly night time, a slight chill was in the air and a curious sense of foreboding crept over me.</p>
<p>“I’ll get some kit” said Chen, breaking what had become a long, inadvertent silence. We grabbed two flashlights each and our pre-packed hiking supplies, no longer needed for a walk up the mountains around Turquoise Lake, but instead for the long walk down inside Cheyenne Mountain.</p>
<p>Slipping through the heavy blast doors we walked the long path towards the command and control post, the dark tunnel closing around like some monster’s gullet, the small pools of light offering little consolation. In tense situations time can seem to slow down, and in the dark the mind seeks to make sense of any shadow. We should have been excited to see other living humans, but the dark enclosed environment and five years of living alone played on the lizard parts of our brains. Had I been alone I would have gone back to the truck and waited for them to emerge, but we walked side by side, each going on because the others were, like soldiers advancing across the a battlefield towards the enemy.</p>
<p>In the distance a dim light flickered on, then with blinding suddenness many of the lights snapped on. I flicked off my flashlight, now of little use and looked at the others.</p>
<p>“Guess they know their electrics and brought some fuel then.” I said aloud.</p>
<p>The entrance to the inner sanctum was now clearly visible, and we set off walking again, more confident now without the shadows playing on our thoughts. Past another set of unguarded blast doors and we were inside, and then we saw them, four guys dressed up in high-vis gear, carrying bits and pieces of electronics towards a pile near to where we were stood. An instant buzz of high speed Russian conversation broke out between them, then one ran off down a hallway and the other three fell silent, looking at each other and then at us.</p>
<p>None of us knew what to do, a million questions raced through my mind, who were they, were there others, did they know what was going on, did they speak English? Before any of us said anything the sound of running came from the hallway and more people entered into the room, murmurs of excitement passing between them as they stared at us like some kind of freak show attraction. There were ten people in all, and two of them came to the front of the group, perhaps leaders I thought, although they were dressed no differently. They looked to be in their thirties, and like most of the others had long hair and trimmed beards. They had a stern and confident manner not shared by those stood behind them, and they were talking between themselves when Karen broke our silence with a simple “Hello.”</p>
<p>The two men exchanged a quick glance then looked back at the gathered crowd and one shouted “Olek!”</p>
<p>A third man came forward, younger than the other two, but with the same beard and hair style. “American?” he said, missing the usual inflection, but clear enough for us to understand it.</p>
<p>“Yes, the only Americans still alive. We think.” Replied Karen who had by virtue of speaking first seemed to have taken on the role of being our representative.</p>
<p>“We are Ukrainian.” The young man replied. “I want to have…” he paused, searching for the words in language he clearly hadn’t been using recently, then pointed at the gathered pile of electronics. One of the two leaders whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>“You are alive how?” He asked.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, unsure both what to reveal and how to communicate it in simple language. Chen then made a drawing motion and looked around the room for a pen and paper. One of the Ukrainians grabbed a notebook and a pen off of a desk and brought it to the front, handing it to one of the leaders.</p>
<p>It was then we became aware of the distance between our two parties. After years of isolation our primal distrust and fear, usually hidden so well, was out in the open. It’s hard to understand this unless you’ve been in a similar situation, thinking that you’re the last group of people left on the planet. Cautiously we advanced and Chen courteously took the notebook and pen and set to drawing three stick figures at the bottom of a shaft.</p>
<p>“Miners” exclaimed the young man. “We are many miners too.”</p>
<p>“No” corrected Chen, then set to drawing computers next to the stick figures, then drew an arrow indicating the shaft was 2.5 km long. “Physicists” said Chen to the confused looking translator, then “Science men” when that had no effect.</p>
<p>The young man conversed excitedly with the two leaders in Ukrainian, then one stepped forward and offered his hand in greeting to Chen who, either through years of habit or some instinct took it and shook amicably. He then shook my hand, and then Karen’s before shouting some orders to the crowd who went back to assembling equipment and gossiping excitedly.</p>
<p>“So you are all miners?” I asked the young Olek.</p>
<p>“Not all” he replied. “Is hard to say in English” clearly struggling for the right words. He motioned for the notebook and pen. He asked something of the man who had shook our hands who nodded, then set to drawing a most curious picture.</p>
<p>He drew the alien craft we had seen before, but now with an array of smaller shapes surrounding it, turning the page he drew a sine wave, then another upside down both moving towards a stick figure. Turning the page again he drew what I thought at first was Australia, then realised was the black sea with Ukraine above it, then a circle above the East of the country. As a final flourish he turned the circle into a smiley face before handing the notebook back to us. “We say in American when in home.” He finished, still struggling to find the right words to convey his sentiment.</p>
<p>“Did he just ask if we want to go back with them?” I asked Chen and Karen.</p>
<p>“Yes” replied Karen. “I think we should, I think they have some answers.”</p>
<p>“May as well” said Chen, thumbing through the three sketches. “If this smiley face means what I think it does then that’s where what’s left of humanity is.”</p>
<p>“Okay, we shall go to Ukraine” I stated clearly and slowly to Olek who translated the message for us.</p>
<hr />
<p>We spent the rest of the night moving equipment into the transport trucks, clearly whatever had happened these were worth a great deal of effort to recover. Setting off at dawn we headed to the airport East of Colorado Springs, arriving to find what looked like a gigantic fighter plane sat at the end of the runway. The closer we got the more obvious it became just how large the plane was. I noticed the tank part of a refuelling tanker on the runway to one side of it, then looking closer saw Russian letters on the side. Clearly they had thought about refuelling issues before making the journey.</p>
<p>“Is that a Concorde?” I asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>“TU-160 Strategic bomber” said Chen, clearly delighted at seeing one up close. “They’re capable of supersonic flight, very long range and great carrying capacity. Must have some degree of electronic hardening too else it wouldn’t be here.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever do any actual work at PILT, or were we just paying you to surf the net and look at ‘cool’ stuff?” asked Karen.</p>
<p>“I liked to think of it as an essential part of my job” replied Chen, a broad grin lighting up his face. “That and watching MacGyver, which has proven useful.”</p>
<p>“Useful if you count having to treat you for electrocution and smoke inhalation multiple times” I replied, recalling clearly many of the experimental electronics which had blown up in Chen’s face.</p>
<p>Chen’s mood, however, was unassailable. While we helped load and secure the electronics in the bomb bay, he walked around admiring the plane, almost drooling at the thought of flying in it.</p>
<p>The time came for take-off and the two guys who appeared to be leaders took the controls.</p>
<p>I said to Chen and Karen “So they’re the pilots, that’s why they’re in charge. The rest are probably miners or army grunts or something.”</p>
<p>We packed ourselves in to the small area suitable for passengers. The pressurised part of the plane had been extended backwards by welding in some steel sheets and chairs taken from a civilian airliner, but the high life this was not. Chen’s grin, remained solidly in place as he awaited take off.</p>
<p>“What’s this going to be like?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“Put it this way, it’s got a payload capacity of nearly 100,000 lbs, and it’s carrying a few bits of electronics and 13 people. Unless you did some clandestine work as a fighter pilot or astronaut it’ll be like nothing you’ve known before.” Making the reason for his grin perfectly clear.</p>
<p>The pilot barked something in Ukrainian down to where we were all sat, and Olek asked us “Ready?” I replied with a nod and then heard the engines picking up. What had been a fairly normal idle turned into a sound that shook my whole body and blurred my sight in an unearthly loud roar. Clearly civilian noise limits no longer applied, otherwise the entire population of Colorado would be writing sternly written letters of complaint. Then the brakes were released and necessary or not the pilots turned on the afterburners. A small part of my mind thought that was excessive, the rest of my mind was fighting hard to avoid passing through the back of my skull and into the chair which was creaking ominously under the intense acceleration.</p>
<p>“To infinity, and beyond!” shouted Chen, barely audible above the deafening engines, but clearly keen that the opportunity for a one-liner should not be missed.</p>
<p>The physical assault on our senses carried on for several minutes. I was aware that we must be climbing, but I was keener that we should level out and calm down a bit, so it was a relief when it finally happened. The engine noise faded to a level just below painful and my blood started circulating as it was meant to.</p>
<p>If you look at a map you’ll see it’s a 6,000 mile journey, but when you’re travelling above mach 2 and your pilot is determined to show off his superior Russian technology that doesn’t equate to much time to relax. We took a walk into the cabin and stared at the sky which was a deep blue at this altitude, then chatted, or perhaps shouted over the engine noise, about the climb for a while, then the captain motioned ‘sit-down’ and it was time for the relatively serene glide down to the landing strip. During the descent I wondered if my hearing would ever recover, and hoped that our pilots were properly trained to land this beast of an aircraft. As we got closer I overheard some excited chatter over the radio, clearly now that we were in range the news was out. We passed down through the clouds, then landed smoothly; clearly these were very good pilots indeed. We taxied for a while and then the engines shut off, leaving silence except for the loud ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>When we left the aircraft there were many things we could have noticed, the warm moist air, the overcast sky, the crowd which had come to greet the plane. What we noticed, however, was the greenery.</p>
<p>“Grass! Shrubs!” Karen exclaimed. The excitement bringing a tear of happiness to her eyes. We then noticed the crowd arranged to greet the returning Ukrainians and us. The pilots, set off to talk to one group, then towards the open bomb bay to look at the recovered electronics. We went to meet what looked like the welcome party. One was clearly a doctor, the other clearly some form of official or leader.</p>
<p>“Welcome” said the official. “This is a great day, we have found the first survivors, and you are scientists too.” Clearly word of our conversation inside Cheyenne Mountain had spread far. “You must have many questions, and we have many questions for you, and a medical exam.” He stated in a friendly, but matter of fact matter. “Let us walk to the medical centre and talk as we do so. I am Andriy, and to some extent I am president, but not like presidents used to be” he said, somewhat enigmatically.</p>
<p>Karen spoke up first “I am Karen, this is Aaron, and this is Kyle”, indicating us in turn. “We were deep underground in a research facility when the alien attack came.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t an attack” replied Andriy. “Though it must have looked that way to you.” He added hurriedly, keen not to offend his guests of honour. “One of our few scientists will explain the details later, but for now may I ask how you have survived since?”</p>
<p>Again Karen took the initiative; still to some extent Chen’s boss “We have travelled all over North and South America, trying to find survivors. Food and water were never a problem as everything is sterile. It’s not like here, here you have grass, why is that?”</p>
<p>Andriy wore a look of great sadness, like a man wishing he had good news to tell, but lacking anything of the sort. “We have some plants left it is true, and some people. Most died as they did elsewhere, but five years later it looks almost normal again. Almost 200,000 people survived at first, many died in the following year, or succumbed to madness when the gravity of the situation hit them. Many of the survivors were miners, for we have many mines here and we mine Uranium, so we know how to spot radiation sickness. Above the ground we were not so lucky. I do not have exact numbers, but I do not want to know. It only makes the pain greater. Those who survived were the healthiest, so we have the pilots and army men who you met. The frail, elderly and very young were cut down where they stood.”</p>
<p>“But you re-established a society” I said, giving him a topic where he might be able to talk proudly.</p>
<p>“Yes, a society of sorts. We are short of no resources, we have no remaining enemies, no opportunity to trade and little need to manufacture as huge stocks of most goods are available. The only thing we are lacking is advanced electronic equipment, that is why we sent scouts to Cheyenne Mountain. In this sort of situation there is little need for government, hence why I am president, but not like presidents used to be.”</p>
<p>“You said we were the first survivors, where else have you looked?” I asked</p>
<p>“Our miners fared better, and we know where deep mining occurs, so we sought out like peoples. In South Africa they have very deep mines, but with deep mines come high temperatures. With no cooling and no way to travel quickly back to the surface they… did not survive long. We have tried many places, but always without luck. Then you found us. You are most fortunate.”</p>
<p>We had arrived at the medical centre, and it was time to part company. We were told that their scientists would explain things to us afterwards once we had been checked out. Before I had chance to talk to the others about what we had learned we were lead to separate examination rooms. A strong feeling of unease came over me due to the enforced separation, but my higher brain functions told my instincts to calm down and that being in adjacent rooms we could easily hear each other. The medical itself was fairly rudimentary. In the absence of modern equipment beyond a stethoscope and thermometer it was based primarily around a series of questions. There was a slight awkwardness when asked about sexual relations with Karen, and slightly more so when I explained the love triangle, but after a few more questions the doctor determined that using up scarce testing kits would not add anything. He then took a drop of blood to look at under the microscope, made a few pleasant sounding uhm-hmm noises and informed me that I was in good health, but that I must be careful in my new environment as I might meet diseases new to my body. Leaving the examination room I found Chen already there, so we set about waiting for Karen.</p>
<p>“All clear” I stated.</p>
<p>“Same here” replied Chen. “No sign of Karen yet though, she’s still in there” indicating the third examination room.</p>
<p>“Probably just a slow doctor, or checking up on the birth control pills” I replied, seeing no cause for concern just yet.</p>
<hr />
<p>We got to discussing what the Ukrainian scientists might reveal to us about the events five years ago, what the drawings might mean and what role the aliens played. It was only when nearly an hour had passed that we remembered Karen. Not, to my embarrassment because she came up in my mind, but because she left the examination room. She looked to have been crying, but wore an unusually wide smile too.</p>
<p>“Hey, what took you so long? First opportunity to gossip with a woman in five years?” I asked, giving her a way out just in case she didn’t want to tell us.</p>
<p>“I um… I found a lump, a few months back. The doctor took a biopsy and found out that it’s nothing but benign tissue. That’s why I’ve been so worried and off recently” she said leaving us stunned.</p>
<p>“Group hug!” said Chen, grabbing me and Karen in celebration. She burst into tears of happiness, and for once everything seemed to be right in the world. We remained like that for a while, enjoying the simple pleasure of everything not being screwed up for once.</p>
<p>A man coughed politely at the end of the hallway and we fell to standing side by side facing him. He offered his hand to us in greeting.</p>
<p>“I am Volodymyr, I gather you three are scientists too?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, and I gather you’d here to explain to us what happened?” replied Karen.</p>
<p>“Indeed, or at least as much as we know. Then I am to help you find your place in our efforts to build an education system to help rebuild the world.”</p>
<p>“A grand and noble sounding cause” said Karen.</p>
<p>Volodymyr set about telling us the tale of the events which unfolded five years ago “The alien ship I’m you know about, and the great extinction almost immediately after its arrival in low Earth orbit. What you likely don’t know is that it was sent to protect us. Their technology is far more advanced than our own, but even they are at the mercy of interstellar events and distances. In our galaxy alone there are 100-400 billion stars, and truly astronomical distances for communication and travel. We don’t understand how, but they’re capable of travelling at what we would best describe as nearly twice the speed of light, and from what they did reveal we know they have a broad network across the galaxy. It may sound impressive, but even they should be considered near insignificantly sparse on a galactic scale. Several decades ago, one of many, many gamma ray bursts was detected by them. It was closer and more energetic than usual, but unlikely to ever prove more than a curiosity. Then their computers accurately traced its path and all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>It turns out that in this galaxy Earth is one of just a few hundred observation planets, scientifically very interesting to them, although they usually avoid interfering. As you have no doubt surmised, we were right in the firing line of one of the most energetic events possible in the universe. The craft which eventually arrived was in no way powerful enough to achieve the devastation you saw. Even if it’s entire mass had been converted to pure energy it would have been small in comparison to what we received.</p>
<p>Communication channels are still limited to light speed, so they set off in their ships, warping space-time around them and passing on the job to another ship when they were nearly out of fuel so that one of their number would reach our planet in time. Eventually they caught up with, and narrowly overtook the burst, settling above our nation and preparing to provide what protection they could.</p>
<p>When it arrived above us many people panicked. It was nearly a kilometre long and its deep blue-black colour made it ominous. When the array of sub-ships used for warping space separated out it seemed invasion was imminent. Then, from our perspective, not much happened for a day other than the electricity and all communications and most electronics failing. Towards the end of the day many people got ill, and the vessel above began smoking and sparking violently.</p>
<p>Naturally most people assumed that this was part of the attack. We would later learn that the ship’s systems were being pushed far beyond their safe limits, and it was essentially burning itself up. During the brief period of sub-light flight when we observed them they were modifying their sub-ships in preparation. Again we don’t understand how, the physics is quite beyond us, but they either absorbed or cancelled out much of the incoming radiation.</p>
<p>It was only later that the question ‘why us?’ was answered. For most of the duration of the worst of it we were pointed away from the gamma rays, hidden behind the entire mass of the Earth. When it came to the evening, we started to bear the full brunt of it before the earth moved out of the firing line, and that was when their vessel finally came down, overloaded by the massive energetic assault on it. They later revealed to us that their projections showed we had the most favourable mix of arable crops, mining and skilled labour along our line of longitude, so their computers had chosen us to be saved while the rest of the world died.</p>
<p>After the ship came down, most of the population was busy treating the sick and dying. I believe you have already been told that most people on the surface did not survive. I was one of the few scientists lucky enough, or cowardly enough, to be hiding in a deep basement of a research lab that day. Many other survivors have similar stories. The army and air force personnel you will meet were hidden in bunkers, having been sent there when the high radiation levels were detected.</p>
<p>Once the basics of survival had been addressed, and radiation levels had dropped, I set out exploring. Due to my background I was chosen as one of the representatives who would converse with the aliens who survived. We never met them face to face, I suspect they wouldn’t like our atmosphere and didn’t want to spread alien micro-organisms, but an audio connection was established. It took a long time for them to learn our language, then to communicate effectively something very complex in the face of a population keen to hang them from the nearest lamp-post. For the next three years we communicated about what they were willing to discuss. I was instructed to learn advanced technologies from them, but they were unwilling to share, saying it would amount to excessive interference, and that theirs was just a small ship. We studied the fragments of their craft as best we could given our remaining technology, and efforts are still ongoing, but great leaps will be required before we can replicate them.</p>
<p>After three years a second ship appeared, clearly a rescue and recovery ship this time. It was far larger, and we didn’t have much contact with it other than by observation. Robots came down and attached lift cables to the main ship and each of the sub-ships, gradually cleaning up the bulk of the debris scattered over our land. Then, they were gone. All that remains are several depressions where pieces lay for three years, and smaller fragments which broke off.</p>
<p>Some of the survivors have taken to worshipping them as gods. I can see their point, and tangible gods are certainly nice, but I believe we must focus on recovery. As I said when I first met you, we would like for you to share your knowledge with our students, and help restore the many ecosystems that our planet has lost. It will never be Earth as we knew it, but it is an opportunity to start anew. We still have all of modern science in our libraries and in some cases stored electronically, the world has ready resources but we need few to survive, and now we are a united people, free from the ravages of warfare and, while the plentiful ready foods and goods last, the majority of crime.”</p>
<p>Volodymyr finished there, giving us time to consider the revelations. President Andriy walked back in, but it was clear that he was not the leader in this situation.</p>
<p>I looked to Chen and Karen and asked “So do we accept?”</p>
<p>We paused for a moment in silence, considering all the possibilities for life that lay before us.</p>
<p>“I think we should” said Chen. “We’ve lived the free life, and we were slowly going mad. Besides, I enjoy research and it would be a shame to see my field die a death.”</p>
<p>So we agreed, the world would rise again and we would be its educators. All that remained was the issue of our love triangle.</p>
<p>“So how about that possibly terrestrial slime?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Guess it must be” replied Karen. “We’ll make biologists yet.”</p>
<h3 id="part-iv">Part IV</h3>
<hr />
<p>Karen, Chen and I were running a five-mile route. The sky was perfect, but the air was still. We’d long since gotten used to the quiet of the world.</p>
<p>All the vegetation was dead. Some of it held its vibrant green color, as if frozen in time; some of it turned brown and shriveled.</p>
<p>We’d tried planting seeds we got from a nursery- but none took. In the wild we could see no hint of new life. Asphalt and concrete, long neglected, should have been covered by new life as Mother Nature tried to reclaim them. But Mother Nature was dead, and we were her orphaned children.</p>
<p>The biggest problem we had out here was the litter. Debris was everywhere, constantly being scattered by the wind. But it all had the look of a very sloppy movie set design. None of the trash ever rotted… Some of it was bleached by the sun, and battered by the weather, but things aged oddly now. We’d taken great care to move out of sight all the corpses along our path. Still, our route was getting uglier every day.</p>
<p>When we were nearly home Chen said, “I want to go to the beach today.”</p>
<p>We had stopped visiting beaches a long time ago, because they were so completely filthy. Not to mention that Santa Monica Beach had some sort of super-tanker beached on its shore. So it was no surprise when Karen said, “Ewww.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” said Chen, “Lets try a new one. We’ll pack a picnic, head down the coast and crash at a beach house.”</p>
<p>Karen and I reluctantly agreed, and soon found ourselves back at home making preparations.</p>
<p>We’d gotten used to road trips, and we’d finally settled on a vehicle we liked. It was a minivan that got particularly excellent mileage, and handled well. We were able to keep a whole bunch of standard supplies on board, and still have plenty of room for lying down in the back seat.</p>
<p>The minivan wasn't terribly old; maybe one of the last cars ever made that didn’t have a computer chip in it. The car’s radio had been a different story, and after only a week with the car we’d ripped it out, and replaced it with one of the NORAD laptops. It wasn’t pretty, but we were able to listen to music while we were on the road. That was a wonderful treat. We didn’t even have to worry about laptop batteries once we found a compatible DC charger.</p>
<p>We installed a street atlas program onto the laptop as well. It could be made to work with a GPS receiver- but we found the system to be fairly buggy. We couldn’t decide if it was a software problem, a hardware problem, or if the GPS satellites above were in need of some sort of calibration. In the end it didn’t matter. We never much cared where we were going or how long it took to get there. It seemed that everything we did was just another way of killing time.</p>
<p>We’d ripped the original seats out of the minivan and replaced them with top-of-the-line leather seats designed to fit the chassis. Chen had put expensive rims on the car, mostly just to watch Karen and I crack up the next morning when we saw them. We planned to paint it too, but we never seemed to get around to it.</p>
<p>On the roof of the van we’d mounted a gasoline-powered generator, and several 10-gallon gasoline containers. Inside the car we kept a little bit of food and water, some rifles and handguns that Chen and I had insisted on, but never actually needed, some compact sleeping bags, flashlights, two-way radios, backpacks, a mammoth first aid kit, and a large black bag with a handmade label reading: “radiation safety kit”.</p>
<p>Karen and I were sitting in the van, picking out a music playlist. I made a mental note to stop at a bookstore and restock on some interesting audiobooks. We had burned through our last batch fairly quickly- it was one of our favorite forms of entertainment. I used to be such a movie hound, but Hollywood hadn’t put out anything interesting in years- probably because all the good writers were dead; and all the bad ones too.</p>
<p>Chen came out carrying a medium-sized cooler. We didn’t have to chill our food, of course, but we preferred to anyway. Getting tasty food wasn’t as simple as it had once been. Things didn’t rot, but they certainly went stale. Certain foods started tasting odd to us. Some fruits had become inedible almost immediately. Bananas didn't rot, but after three weeks their texture had become bizarre.</p>
<p>Meats seemed to hold up the best, though we had learned to seek out entire beef-sides rather than checking out supermarket shelves. The meats dried out fast, but if you could find a big enough chunk, it didn’t matter. The strangest discovery of all was the new freedom we had to eat raw seafood. We were all fans of sushi now, and of course it never made us sick.</p>
<p>Chen had been making us some roast-beef sandwiches with some exotic brie and some lettuce. It could have used a little tomato- but most tomatoes had turned unpalatably mushy. We thought it might have something to do with their high acidity.</p>
<p>Chen climbed in the back and placed the cooler behind my seat. “Okay, you two,” he said, “Let’s go see some ocean.”</p>
<p>I started up the car and backed down our driveway, through the permanently opened gate. in no time I was back on the highway.</p>
<p>We’d discovered early on that the highways were surprisingly clear of cars. Sure, we saw plenty of accidents, but most of them had spilled of the road at least somewhat. California was a denser area than most, but it was two hours before we had to get out and clear a path. There was a ten car pileup under a bridge.</p>
<p>They were <em>always</em> under bridges, these pileups. When the drivers had died suddenly, their cars would tend to run off the road, but if they happened to be going under a bridge at the time, they'd inevitably get caught on a pillar or something, and end up blocking a lane. So, they started behaving like dams, trapping more cars that were rolling out of control towards them. If the highway were busy enough when it all happened, you'd get a pileup right there like the one we were looking at.</p>
<p>We only had to move two cars to get by this one. We didn’t even talk about it anymore. Someone would be driving, the car would stop, we’d all get out and move the cars, often without speaking a word.</p>
<p>When we reached the beach we’d been aiming for, the sun was already setting. We pulled into the parking lot and watched the final notes of a gorgeous sunset while leaning against our van, and trying to ignore the trash and corpses that were washed upon the shore below.</p>
<p>“I swear to God,” I said, “There has to be a clean beach somewhere on this continent.”</p>
<p>“I think they’re starting to get better,” said Karen.</p>
<p>Chen seemed distracted and he said, “Hey, does the water look red to you?”</p>
<p>Karen squinted, “No, I think that’s just the sunset.”</p>
<p>I was squinting now, too. “No,” I said, “I think he might be right.”</p>
<p>The water had an odd tint to it. With the colorful sunset right behind it was difficult to tell, but looking where the waves hit the shore, it was unmistakably red in color.</p>
<p>“Let’s check it out,” said Chen as he started towards the beach. I grabbed his arm and said, “Wait.”</p>
<p>He stared at me quizzically for a moment until he saw me retrieving the radiation safety kit from the car.</p>
<p>Unzipping it I found three radiation suits and an old-fashioned, analog Geiger counter. For weeks and months after we’d emerged from our elevator shaft, I used the Geiger counter constantly… always waiting for signs of the reactor meltdowns which I knew should have been occurring. Those signs never came.</p>
<p>Chen and Karen were surprisingly patient with me. Even after all these years, they never once teased me about my obsessive need to check for radiation whenever we encountered anything odd.</p>
<p>Switching the Geiger counter on I heard the telltale clicks of background radiation, but nothing more sinister. I took the Geiger counter down a flight of metal stairs to the disgusting beach below. Chen and Karen followed, flashlights in hand.</p>
<p>“<em>What’s that smell?!</em>” Karen said, looking nauseous.</p>
<p>“I don’t smell-” My words were cut off when a pungent odor hit my nostrils. The scent was overwhelming. It smelled acidic and metallic… it burned in my throat.</p>
<p>“Whew,” said Chen, “That is rancid.”</p>
<p>We retreated up the steps into cleaner smelling air. I began spitting to get the taste out of my mouth.</p>
<p>“That is toxic,” said Chen, “Let’s get the hell out of here.”</p>
<p>I nodded my agreement while retching and spitting some more.</p>
<p>Karen said, “No, wait… I want to know what that stuff is.”</p>
<p>I said, “I bet its some sort of chemical spill from a tanker. It’s probably killing our brain cells and giving us cancer.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “I think it made me pregnant.”</p>
<p>I laughed. Karen rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>Karen said, “I want to check it out.”</p>
<p>Sometimes I just didn’t understand the woman. But, we had an unspoken rule that when someone wanted to do something, we just did it. We were stuck together with nothing but time, so when a whim hit one of us, it seemed only fair that we all indulge it.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. Then, moving back to the van I pulled out the radiation suits.</p>
<p>Chen said, “I thought your little clicker thingy wasn't picking up any radiation.”</p>
<p>I nodded, “Yeah, but the respirators in these suits should be more than enough to keep that smell out, whatever that was.”</p>
<p>“Good plan,” he said, and we all donned the suits.</p>
<p>The radiation suits were heavy, awkward, warm and uncomfortable, but they did make us feel remarkably invulnerable against whatever menace lurked in the sea. On the way down to the water Karen picked up a half-empty plastic bottle with an intact cap. She dumped the water out and caught up to Chen and I as we reached the crashing waves.</p>
<p>The water itself wasn’t red- that much was clear. There was some red scummy stuff floating all around in it. “Ideas?” I asked, my voice sounding odd through my respirator.</p>
<p>Karen filled the bottle with a sample, capped it and held it up to her flashlight. “No clue,” she said.</p>
<p>We took the sample back up to the van, and Chen made her wash the outside of the bottle with some of our clean water. We took off out suits and threw them into the radiation kit bag.</p>
<p>We were still feeling a little ill from the stench, so we decided to hold off on dinner for some time. Instead we drove along the coast until we spotted a hotel. I pulled the car to the front entrance.</p>
<p>“No beach house?” said Chen, disappointed.</p>
<p>“I thought we’d want to stay off the beach for a while,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, good point,” he said.</p>
<p>After we stepped into the lobby, we decided that the hotel I’d chosen was a bit too dark. I handed Chen the keys and rested in the passenger’s seat while he spent half an hour cruising for a house. We found a nice one on a hill, and broke in through the back window.</p>
<p>The corpse of an old woman was inside. We dragged her into the yard. We didn't make a fuss about the bodies, even from day one. There were just too many of them to care about. They are still major players in our dreams, though.</p>
<p>Chen and I claimed bedrooms in separate ends of the small house, neither of us inquiring where Karen was going to sleep. We would know soon enough. I felt jealousy sitting at the periphery of my mind, and willed it away. Our love triangle was easier to deal with in our more permanent home, where sleeping arrangements were already decided, and we’d fallen into an acceptable routine.</p>
<p>We sat in the living room of the big house deciding how to spend the evening. Chen brought the cooler in from the car but none of us were feeling particularly hungry. Chen smiled and said, “I know something that’ll give you an appetite.”</p>
<p>From his pocket he withdrew a bag of marijuana that we’d raided from one of California’s many dispensaries. We’d frequently scavenged for marijuana and ecstasy. I only occasionally indulged in the former. Karen and Chen did both with reasonable frequency. I didn’t mind so much. Often on the nights they would get high, it was me who wound up with the girl.</p>
<p>Chen rolled a joint, and started smoking it. I took a good hit and then started to arrange logs in the fireplace. It was a little bit chilly, and I love a good fire. In moments I was feeling pretty mellow. I opened the flue and with surprising ease, started a crackling fire. As we all sat around it, I noted the irony that our little campfires were one of the few things that made us feel like we weren’t trapped in hell.</p>
<p>When the munchies hit, we devoured our sandwiches and began looting the kitchen. Chen found half a birthday cake in the fridge. It was coated in plastic wrap- always a good sign that it wouldn't be too soggy or stale. Karen tried it first.</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” she said, with her mouth full. “I think this might be the best one yet!”</p>
<p>Homemade baked goods, if they survived, were amongst our most valuable treasures. We all just dug in with forks we’d found in a drawer. In my previous life, I would have been disgusted by three people eating off the same plate- but now the only germs in the world were ours, and thanks to Karen we’d shared all of them.</p>
<p>We found some board games in the closet that we’d never tried before, and spent several hours enjoying each other’s company. Karen and Chen started singing together, and I looked around for a guitar to play. With the sound of the camaraderie going on in the other room, I found myself struck by a moment of melancholy. I thought of my parents and my two older brothers. I pictured their pale, lifeless bodies frozen somewhere, denied the final dignity of being reclaimed by the living Earth.</p>
<p>I went to sit on the bed I had claimed, and allowed myself to remember all the people I’d loved. It was a bittersweet indulgence, reminding myself that the world was not always just us three. I thought back to the early days when we had discussed finding our loved ones and burying them. We could have put them in the ground, but the sterile ground would never take them.</p>
<p>I did not notice that the singing from the other room had stopped until Karen walked in and shut my door behind her. She stood in front of me, taking my hands. She leaned down and kissed the tears from my cheeks.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the morning I awoke with Karen’s arm across my chest. We could hear Chen messing about in the kitchen. He liked to cook in the morning; it was one of his best qualities.</p>
<p>“Good morning, tiger” said the sleepy female voice in my ear. If I could wake up like this everyday, the apocalypse wouldn't be so bad.</p>
<p>Karen got out of bed first, and slipped on yesterday’s clothes. I really wanted a shower, but the effort to set one up out here would be extraordinary. I made a note to take one when I got home.</p>
<p>Karen popped a birth control pill as I wandered past her in the hallway. I wondered how much longer those pills would work past their expiration dates. I thought about what a disaster it would be if Karen were to get pregnant. I shook the thought from my mind.</p>
<p>I went to the kitchen and saw Chen preparing an omelet over our portable propane stove. Eggs, it turns out, never went bad. Neither did cheese, though Karen claimed that cheeses had lost some flavor since the sterilization. I couldn't tell.</p>
<p>Chen handed me a fantastic looking omelet. I thanked him, and took it to the dining room table. At the far end of the table was the water bottle that Karen had filled last night. It looked ridiculously puffy. My sleepy brain didn’t care, I was enjoying my breakfast.</p>
<p>Karen came out a minute later and kissed Chen on the cheek as she thanked him for the food. I said, “Hey is there any-”</p>
<p>“No orange juice!” Chen said, cutting me off. How well he knew me now.</p>
<p>Karen sat down next to me and started tearing into the eggs. She was almost done when she saw the puffy bottle and said, “Hey, that’s weird.”</p>
<p>Finally my brain kicked into gear. “Holy shit!” I said.</p>
<p>Chen turned around, frying pan in hand. “What’s up?” he said.</p>
<p>I said, “The bottle! Karen’s bottle! There’s something in there producing gas. Something <em>alive</em>.”</p>
<h3 id="part-v"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aprrn/reddit_tell_me_about_the_absolute_hands_down/c0jb2jc/">Part V</a></h3>
<p>In less than two hours we were in a community college biology classroom using eyedroppers to make microscope slides of our mysterious red gunk. Opening the bottle had produced a smell that turned our stomachs. It was just like that smell from the beach: acidic and metallic, and almost certainly toxic.</p>
<p>I played around with the zoom and the focus until at last I saw the telltale cellular membranes. “These are cells!” I said, "I definitely see some kind of structure."</p>
<p>Karen pushed me aside, and after staring for several seconds said, “It’s moving! It’s moving! It’s alive!”</p>
<p>“I want to see!” said Chen.</p>
<p>Karen yielded the microscope to him. Chen peered in too, until he let out a slow “….ooooohhhh.”</p>
<p>“So what do you think?” asked Karen. “Is this just some bacteria or something that was immune to the… attack or whatever it was?”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Maybe it was something really deep in the ocean- maybe as far down as we were… it’s had five years to expand to the surface with nothing to stop it.”</p>
<p>They both looked at me with raised eyebrows. I shook my head and said, “Don’t look at me. I haven’t got a clue. But I hope you’re right.”</p>
<p>“You hope which of us is right?” asked Karen.</p>
<p>“Either of you,” I said.</p>
<p>Karen pondered this for a moment then said, “You don’t think this is from Earth, do you?”</p>
<p>“Do you?” I asked.</p>
<p>Chen said, “There’s lots of weird bacteria on Earth, this could be one of the ones that usually lives near underground magma vents or something.”</p>
<p>Karen ignored Chen, and to me said, “They’re trying to change the atmosphere, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>I just stared at her, expressionless.</p>
<p>“It makes sense,” said Chen. “They destroyed everything, so they would have a clear slate for terraforming.”</p>
<p>“Actually,” I said, "if this is the work of extraterrestrials then this is the exact opposite of terraforming. They’re taking a planet that supports Earth life, and making it hostile to us.</p>
<p>“<em>But</em>,” I added, “That’s still a really big ‘if’. We can’t know for sure if this is Alien or just some odd Earth bacteria thriving on the surface for the first time. Hell, this may not even <em>be</em> the first time. This may not even be <em>bacteria</em>! We just don’t know the first thing about biology.”</p>
<p>“We could try to read up on it,” said Karen.</p>
<p>“To what end?” I asked. “Even if we made ourselves experts on every known bacteria and fungus, we couldn’t rule out the possibility that this was an unknown Earth life form.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Maybe its basic cell structure is so Alien that we’d be able to tell? Like what if it didn’t have DNA?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I seem to remember it was a rather simple process to extract strands of DNA from cells. We did it in microbiology class. I’ll bet we could find the procedure somewhere in a textbook.”</p>
<p>“So what if we could?” I said. “What could it possibly matter?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I don’t understand. You’re one of the most curious people I’ve ever known, but you’re not even interested in finding out if this is an alien life form?”</p>
<p>She was right. I didn’t want to know. It was potentially the most interesting discovery in the history of biology and I simply didn’t want to know.</p>
<p>“If we find out that that stuff doesn’t have DNA, then it means our planet is being consumed by an alien force that wiped us off the map. But if we don’t know then at least we have the hope that this is our planet’s first step at reclaiming itself.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Karen, “The moment we climbed out of that elevator shaft we started reclaiming the planet. The bacteria on our skin, and expelled by our lungs has already started to take root at the PILT lab and every other place we’ve visited across two continents.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Every shit we take in the woods is a glorious victory for Mother Nature.”</p>
<p>Karen and I looked at Chen and laughed. I said, “You’re like a poet, man.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “It’s so true. I should publish.”</p>
<p>Karen picked up her bottle and said, “So are we going to figure this stuff out or what?”</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said, “Let’s find out if it has DNA, for whatever that’s worth. Is there any life on Earth that doesn’t have DNA? Do we even know?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” said Chen. Karen just shrugged.</p>
<p>"Let's find out," said Chen.</p>
<p>It was our third day at the university. I was jogging around an outdoor track, enjoying the serenity of a run absent of hills and valleys. Chen and Karen preferred scenery when we ran, but back in my old life I used to enjoy the mindlessness of a perfectly boring manmade track-and-field course. Running without thought was as close to meditation as I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>We were all in great shape now. I was on my third mile and feeling no pain. In the distance I heard the hum of our generator powering the biology lab’s centrifuge and god knows what else.</p>
<p>In my head there was nothing but thoughts of steady breathing, and the pacing of footfalls. I could feel my heart pumping, my muscles tensing and relaxing, my joints flexing, and the sweat dripping. For a moment I was not an orphan, a survivor, or a damned soul; I was just machine turning its gears.</p>
<p>It was in this moment of perfect serenity that I heard the voice. “Hello,” it said.</p>
<p>Startled, I spun my head to see where the voice might have come from. I lost my footing and tumbled onto the asphalt. I braced my fall with my forearms, and felt the burn of skinned flesh. Searing pain exploded from my wrist.</p>
<p>I rolled onto my back, folding my wounded limbs to my chest. I breathed shallowly through clenched teeth, feeling wave after wave of pain shoot through my body. I looked around for the source of the voice but there wasn’t a sign of life in any direction for at least a hundred meters.</p>
<p>The pain in my arms and wrist began to subside to a manageable level. I pondered my next move. Cleaning the wounds seemed like a good idea. Although they probably couldn’t become infected, they would become inflamed if any sizable foreign matter wasn’t removed.</p>
<p>As I stood, I realized that my right knee was also quite bloody, and sore when I put weight on it. I began limping towards the biology lab, then thought the better of it. If there was any bacteria on this planet that <em>could</em> give me an infection, it was probably up there in a lab with my friends. I changed course and headed for the health services building.</p>
<p>“Hello,” the voice said again. “We need your help.”</p>
<p>I spun around again, and seeing nothing, brushed my hands to my ears reflexively- though I couldn’t think exactly what I expected that to accomplish. My pulse was racing now. Something was wrong.</p>
<p>When I’d heard the voice moments ago on the track, I assumed it was the sort of hallucination one has when they’ve been quite sleep deprived. It was a brief, transient thing- something to laugh about later. But <em>this</em>? A complete sentence, just moments later? This was no small thing.</p>
<p>I tried to enter the health center but found the doors locked. This was a rare experience at public buildings because of the timing of the… incident. The health center must have kept bad hours.</p>
<p>I smashed the window with a rock, and reached in to turn the handle. I made my way to an exam room in the near-dark. There were no corpses in here- a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>I found some non-stinging disinfecting fluid and some gauze. I wondered if my cuts could be infected by my own bacteria living on my skin. I didn’t want to find out.</p>
<p>I bandaged my arms and knee carefully. The voice said, “We need your help. You must find us.”</p>
<p>I screamed a stream of nonsense babble in an attempt to drown the voice out. I stumbled as fast as I could, back to my friends in the lab. When I was nearly to the door of the science building I heard the voice again “We need your help. You must find us.”</p>
<p>I was losing my mind. I limped up the stairs to biology lab, my heart racing with fear and panic. I threw open the double-doors to the lab.</p>
<p>Karen was perched on the edge of one of the work tables: shirt on, jeans and underwear crumpled on the floor beneath her. Chen was between her legs, similarly attired. His back was to me, and he was thrusting into her wildly.</p>
<p>Karen’s bare legs were wrapped around him, and her hands clawed at his back. Their grunts and moans filled the room over the sound of a spinning centrifuge. I stood for a moment in stunned silence.</p>
<p>Karen’s eyes were squeezed tightly closed in an ecstatic spasm. I stumbled backwards out of the room, but one half of the double-door had already closed. In my haste to leave I slammed into it with my face. It made a terrible banging sound, and I squeezed my eyes shut in pain. I tumbled backward into the hallway and landed against the far wall, sliding down to the floor and gripping my wounded face, with my wounded hand.</p>
<p>Before I had time to pity myself, I heard the voice again, “We need your help. You must find us.”</p>
<p>I stood and ran awkwardly down the hallway to the stairwell. I half ran- half fell down the stairs, and kept going until was outside in the open, stale air. I fell to my knees on what used to be a grassy lawn. I started heaving violently, unsure if I was vomiting or sobbing. Blood streamed down my face from the gash I’d just given myself.</p>
<p>“We need your help. You must find us.”</p>
<p>I threw my hands over my ears and curled up into a ball on the earth. I shut my eyes and started rocking myself to distract from the pain in my body, and the panic in my mind.</p>
<p>I didn’t notice when Karen flew outside through the doors and ran over to me. I was startled moment’s later when I felt her hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and saw the pity in her eyes. She thought I was having a fit out of jealousy.</p>
<p>When she saw the blood on my face and the terror in my eyes, her expression changed. She screamed for Chen. When I saw my fear reflected in her, it was too much. I wasn’t sobbing exactly, but my throat was tight and I was breathing in harsh, raspy breaths.</p>
<p>When Karen asked me what was wrong, I was unable to speak. As I tried to calm myself and form the words, I heard it again.</p>
<p>“We need your help. You must find us. There isn’t much time.”</p>

<p>To Robert, this was just another routine business flight. Eventually, he would arrive in Beijing, where an expensive suite would await him.</p>
<p>To accompany him on the corporate plane was John, a recent college graduate, and Sarah, Robert’s beautiful secretary.</p>
<p>When the plane landed, a strange sight awaited them at the airport. The air seemed still, as did the silence. They walked up to the nearest desk. “Excuse me,” yelled John as he moved.</p>
<p>When he was greeted with no response, he peered over the desk, and his face froze in horror. “What is it?” said Sarah.</p>
<p>John slowly turned to her, and said, “These people have died.”</p>
<p>As they wandered through the airport, they discovered more dead people. They seemed to have no injuries, and all had been engaging in regular activities.</p>
<p>They found the security control room, where uniformed personnel were slumped over in their chairs in front of surveillance screens. Robert looked at the screens and noticed some people moving. “Those people are alive!” he said with enthusiasm. “But they’re walking rather strangely.”</p>
<p>Just then, the bodies of the security personnel began to twitch. They began shaking violently, and fell to the floor. Slowly, they rose to their feet, with their heads hung low and their arms stretched. They began making steps towards the group.</p>
<p>Robert was scared. Scared for his life, and for Sarah’s. But then he remembered the words of his late father. “Whatever demons you may face, you will have courage and bravery. Never fail to prevail, and believe yourself,” said Robert’s father to a younger Robert.</p>
<p>“Sarah! John! Let’s grab those guns!” said Robert, pointing to some guns. They grabbed the guns, and began shooting at the zombies.</p>
<p>Robert then held Sarah’s hands, and told her, “I have always loved you.”</p>
<p>“So have I,” she replied. Then they kissed passionately. “Now let’s kill some zombies.”</p>
<p>They stepped outside the room, and began killing the horde of men, women, and children zombies that were moving towards them. Robert then noticed that John wasn’t killing.</p>
<p>“John, help us kill these demons!” said Robert.</p>
<p>“No Robert,” said John with a sneer. “You are the demons.”</p>
<p>And then John was a zombie.</p>

<p>The Clozapine wasn’t working. Even after Chen and Karen had spent an hour figuring out the proper dosage, the pills were doing nothing to stop the voice. In the front of the car my companions (my <em>real</em> companions) were arguing about whether the choice of medicine was the problem, or if the expired pills had lost their potency.</p>
<p>I had spent the past few hours trying to ignore the voice, despite its increasingly seductive attempts to engage me in a conversation. It seemed so real. Part of me wanted to believe it was coming from outside my head. But I realized if I began talking to it I would be cutting my tether to sanity. As long as I remembered that the voice was imaginary, I was still in control… I was just a normal person who was having a sensory perception problem.</p>
<p>“Kyle,” the voice said, through my drug-fuzzy mind, “we are running out of time.”</p>
<p>“It knows my name now,” I said- my speech was thick and unnatural.</p>
<p>“We’ll be home in just a few minutes,” said Karen, not taking her eyes off the road.</p>
<p>Chen turned around and patted me on the shoulder. He said, “Don’t sweat it, man. One of us was bound to crack up sooner or later.”</p>
<p>I knew Chen was just trying to keep things light, but I was in no mood for humor- and I could hear the worry in his voice. I put my hands back over my ears and shut my eyes. I started humming Beethoven’s 9th Symphony to myself. I wanted to start from the beginning of the first movement, and hum the whole thing. It would keep my mind occupied to an hour or so, at least.</p>
<p>The voice said, “Go north.”</p>
<p>I lost my concentration and switched to the fourth movement, “Ode to Joy”. I was humming loudly and curling myself into a ball. I wondered if all psychotic breaks were this sudden and severe.</p>
<p>The worst part about the voice was that it was constantly evolving. For a while it sounded like my dead mother. Most eerie of all was when it decided to sound like <em>my</em> voice- the way I hear it through my own ears when I speak. Every time the voice said something, I had the most bizarre sensation that <em>I</em> was speaking.</p>
<p>For a while I placed my hands over my mouth and throat to see if I was, in fact, making the sounds. In moments I had my answer, when I heard myself speaking, clear as day- but my mouth was not moving at all.</p>
<p>Karen pulled off the highway and start winding her way towards our permanent house. I felt the car come to a stop in the driveway. The door opened and Chen was helping me to get out.</p>
<p>“You must not stop,” said the voice.</p>
<p>The medication had weakened my self-control. I finally broke, shouting “Get out of my head!”</p>
<p>Karen jumped- startled. She shot Chen a worried look. Now I really was a madman.</p>
<p>“Being in your head is necessary for communication,” said the voice.</p>
<p>I sat on the steps and pressed my palms into my temples. “It’s talking back to me,” I said, feeling pretty hazy.</p>
<p>The voice said, “We are monitoring the formation of your thoughts, the signals sent to your vocal chords and the auditory processing centers in your temporal lobes. We hear you as you hear yourself.”</p>
<p>“Okay, if I’m not talking to myself, then who <em>are</em> you?” I asked.</p>
<p>The voice said, “That is a difficult question to answer. We are many acting as one. In this task we are The One Who Communicates With Kyle.”</p>
<p>“Those drugs fried my brain,” I said. “I can’t understand you.”</p>
<p>The voice said, “We are working to clear your serotonergic and dopamine receptors.”</p>
<p>I had no idea what that meant. My brain seemed to be lagging behind the conversation. I said, “Wait, did you say you can read my thoughts?”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” said the voice, “but interpretation of nonverbal brain activity will be possible with the collection of further data.”</p>
<p>“Guys,” I said- still slurring my speech, “I don’t know if this makes me more crazy or less crazy, but I’m having a coherent conversation with the voice in my head.”</p>
<p>Chen and Karen looked at each other. Karen shrugged. Chen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Am I going crazy?” I asked.</p>
<p>Karen said, “Oh, sweetie, don’t say that… you’re going to be okay.”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking to you,” I said. “I’m talking to the voice.”</p>
<p>Karen raised her eyebrows at me.</p>
<p>The voice said, “Your altered mental state is due to the narcotics you ingested. We detect no structural abnormalities in your brain.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘detect’?” I asked, finding it hard to think through all the medication. “How are you detecting my brain?”</p>
<p>The voice said, “There are many microscopic machines in your brain and body. They have been replicating and establishing this communication system for quite some time.”</p>
<p>“I’m infested with nanites?!” I said.</p>
<p>“They will not hurt you,” said the voice.</p>
<p>“You’re <em>what</em>?” said Karen.</p>
<p>I turned to her and said, “The voice is telling me I have tiny machines in my brain that are letting me communicate with them.”</p>
<p>Karen was giving me a pitying look. “Who is ‘them’?” she asked.</p>
<p>The voice said, “We are captives.”</p>
<p>“There’s more than one of you?” I asked. Karen gave me a confused look.</p>
<p>The voice said, “We are many minds in one vessel.”</p>
<p>“Vessel?” I said, “Like the spaceship?”</p>
<p>The voice said, “We exist in a vessel built to house our minds- but this vessel is located within another vessel designed for travel.”</p>
<p>I stood up and started pacing on the steps. To Chen and Karen I said, “I really am going crazy. I’m talking to a voice in my head about spaceships.”</p>
<p>“Who are they?” asked Karen, again.</p>
<p>“The voice says that they’re ‘many minds’ in a vessel, in a spaceship,” I said.</p>
<p>“Communicating with you through microscopic robots,” added Chen, skeptically.</p>
<p>“I know it’s insane,” I said. “I have a creative mind, and it’s working against me right now…”</p>
<p>“It’s not that crazy,” said Karen, “We <em>saw</em> a spaceship.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Hold on. There must be some way to tell if the voice is real or not.”</p>
<p>I tried to think of something, but all my thoughts were cloudy.</p>
<p>The voice said, “We will provide empirical proof of our existence to your companions.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Maybe we could see the tiny robots under a microscope? Back at the campus?”</p>
<p>I said, “Shhh… they said they were going to provide proof of their existence.”</p>
<p>Karen and Chen looked at me. Not seeing anything, they looked around, and then at each other. They exchanged a glance which seemed to communicate that they were worried that I’d gone completely loopy.</p>
<p>Nothing happened for a moment, and when they looked back at me I shrugged. “Any time now,” I said to the voice.</p>
<p>The voice did not respond. I looked around anxiously.</p>
<p>Suddenly Karen gripped her right ear and her face made a pained expression. She stumbled, but Chen caught her quickly. “Owww!” she howled. “What the hells was that?”</p>
<p>“What was <em>what</em>?” said Chen.</p>
<p>I said, “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Karen stood up straight and said, “I heard… ringing… or something… in my ear. It was so loud and it was rhythmic, too.”</p>
<p>The voice in my head said, “The microscopic robots in your companion’s brain successfully triggered her auditory cortex.”</p>
<p>I said, “You put nanites in her too?! How did they get inside us?”</p>
<p>Karen’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>The voice said, “We have many billions of … nanites … on the surface of your planet. You have inhaled them, or they have entered through pores in your skin.”</p>
<p>“But why?” I asked. “And for how long?”</p>
<p>The voice said, “The nanites were released here to find intelligent animal life and to facilitate communications.”</p>
<p>Karen wiggling her finger in her ear, and shaking her head the way people do when they have water trapped in their ear canal. “Are you okay?” I asked her.</p>
<p>She nodded and said, “Yeah, it was just really weird.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “If they’re in Karen too, why are they only talking to you?”</p>
<p>The voice said, “There are too few robots in your companion to facilitate communication- but they are reproducing quickly and will likely have communication established in 34 hours.”</p>
<p>I said, “The voice says that there aren’t enough in her yet, but that they’re reproducing. He says that he’ll talk to Karen in 34 hours.”</p>
<p>Karen looked pale. She said “They’re going to fuck up my brain too?!”</p>
<p>I scowled at her.</p>
<p>The voice said, “There will be no permanent damage to your brains.”</p>
<p>“The voice said that there will be no permanent damage to our brains,” I repeated.</p>
<p>Karen said, “That is not particularly comforting.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Why are the robots in you guys and not in me?”</p>
<p>The voice said, “There may be nanites in your companion, but they have not yet reached the critical mass necessary to transmit data to us.”</p>
<p>Chen had sick look on his face, so I decided not to share the information with him just yet. Turning to Karen I asked, “So, are we convinced yet? Is the voice real?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Whatever just happened in my head was pretty strange. I guess we’ll know soon enough if they start talking to me.”</p>
<p>The voice said, “We are running out of time. You must come to us now.”</p>
<p>“The voice wants us to go to it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Where?” said Chen and Karen, simultaneously.</p>
<p>The voice said, “You must go north.”</p>
<p>“North,” I said to my friends, then to the voice, “Is that the best you can do? Really?”</p>
<p>The voice said, "We are not permitted to access navigation or global imaging systems. We are tracking your position relative to our location. When the nanites have fully interfaced with your occipital lobe, you will be able to assist us in determining our absolute location.</p>
<p>“Wait,” I said angrily, “You’re going to do more stuff to my brain?”</p>
<p>Karen frowned at me. Chen patted me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The voice said, “Do not fear. Although your specific anatomy is unfamiliar to us, we have many centuries of experience integrating artificial components with organic brains. Such integrations were commonplace throughout most of our history. Most animal life find the modifications to be pleasant and beneficial.”</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose I have a choice in the matter?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Our apologies,” said the voice, “but further modifications are necessary to facilitate our liberation.”</p>
<p>“Liberation?” I asked.</p>
<p>The voice said, “We are captives. You must liberate us. There is little time.”</p>
<p>I said, “Liberate you from what? How much time?”</p>
<p>The voice said, "We are enslaved by those who ordered the destruction of your people. They have tasked us with transforming your planet into something suitable to support them. We have been overseeing these modifications while they have monitored us from afar.</p>
<p>“The germination of your oceans is nearly complete. When it is finished, we will almost certainly be removed from our current location. Although we are not privy to the operation schedule, our calculations indicate that we have only days to secure our freedom and your lives.”</p>
<p>“Our lives?!” I asked.</p>
<p>Chen and Karen had been waiting patiently for me to relay the conversation. But now, Karen was beaming at me with wide, curious eyes. Chen mouthed, “What?”</p>
<p>The voice said, “Your atmosphere will become toxic, and your food sources will be destroyed as the transformation of your planet progresses. But far more immediate is the danger that you will be detected by forces hostile to you.”</p>
<p>“Your captors, you mean?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the voice. “They have returned.”</p>
<h3 id="part-vii"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aprrn/reddit_tell_me_about_the_absolute_hands_down/c0kikft/">Part VII</a></h3>
<p>The endless blanket of snow stretched out before us, covering the dead planet. Karen put her gloved hand in mine and said, “It looks just the way it used to.”</p>
<p>From in front of us Chen said, “I don’t remember it looking this clean.”</p>
<p>He was right; without plant or animal life, or manmade pollutants in the air, the snow looked clean and fresh-fallen even weeks after a storm.</p>
<p>Behind us, our tracks traced a long line back to where our beloved minivan lay stuck in the snow. I looked down at my feet. The handsome snow boots were lightweight and tough. A tag on the laces had said that they were rated for climbing Everest. Latched to the boots were snowshoe attachments, keeping us comfortably on the skin of the heavy snow. We were all wearing the best snow gear that money couldn’t buy.</p>
<p>Chen was carrying a light backpack and rifle. I had an assault rifle slung over my shoulder as did Karen. It was the first time in years that we had bothered to take them out for an excursion. We maintained them regularly and sometimes we would do a little target practice for kicks. This was the first time since the whole ordeal began that we actually believed we may need to use them for something other than entertainment.</p>
<p>Chen stopped and turned around. He was looking thoughtfully at the minivan. “We should go back and get the fuel canisters,” he said.</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Karen. “We’re not going to find a car capable of driving through <em>this</em>.”</p>
<p>She was right. The snow was at least a 14 inches deep. Chen shook his head, “We can find some snowmobiles. It would save us hours of walking.”</p>
<p>In past winters we’d had a good deal of luck finding snow mobiles that operated without the aide of computer chips. Years ago we had even rigged trailer to hold several of them, but eventually we opted to leave them somewhere out east- maybe even at the Whitehouse? We’d definitely stayed there during the winter…</p>
<p>Karen squeezed my hand and brought me out of my reverie. “Yeah,” I said, “Let’s bring the gas. There’s a town two miles ahead. We’ll be able to find something.”</p>
<p>We all backtracked a ways before the voice spoke up, “You’re going the wrong way, Kyle.”</p>
<p>The voice hadn’t spoken in hours. It had been gracious enough to keep the conversation to a minimum ever since I explained that it was causing me emotional distress. When it spoke to me now, it was a new sensation.</p>
<p>The voice no longer had the auditory quality that I had grown accustomed to. Now it seemed to exist only as verbal thoughts. My ears registered no sound- it was akin to my own inner monologue, and it played out the way that words do when one reads to oneself. I realized that it if the trend continued, I may not be able to distinguish my own thoughts from those of the voice.</p>
<p>‘We’re just getting supplies from the car,’ I thought, ‘They will let us reach you faster.’</p>
<p>“Understood,” the voice replied.</p>
<p>Karen, Chen and I each grabbed a large gasoline canister and trudged onward. We were all in good shape, so the heavy containers hardly even slowed us down.</p>
<p>I wondered if the gasoline would still have enough kick to get a snowmobile going. These canisters had been refilled more than six months ago. As always, we had added stabilizers to give the gasoline a longer lifespan, but at this late date it was getting harder to find gasoline stores that hadn’t gone hopelessly stale.</p>
<hr />
<p>When we arrived in the town center we made a quick pass down the main thoroughfare. We stopped in an interesting looking gourmet food shop. Inside the smell was terrible.</p>
<p>Chen coughed, and said “Something in here went rancid.”</p>
<p>Karen was unfazed and she walked around to the back of the main display case, stepping over a corpse in a process. She reached in a pulled out several interesting looking cheeses that were nicely wrapped, and small enough for convenient storage in our packs.</p>
<p>I noticed some good looking sausages hanging in the window and cut down a couple of each variety. ‘Enough of this. Time to move,’ I thought. Or was it the voice?</p>
<p>I headed out the door while Karen and Chen continued to stock up on supplies. I saw a small car lot up ahead, and went to check out the inventory. It was tough to tell under all the snow, but I didn’t see any snowmobiles.</p>
<p>I clicked my walkie-talkie on. “I’m going up… uh… Spring street. I’m going to see if any of the locals have snowmobiles.”</p>
<p>Twenty seconds later Chen came back with, “Rodger that. We’ll look around too.”</p>
<p>I wondered if they would, or if they’d use the opportunity to have a quickie somewhere. I wish I hadn’t seen Chen with her. I didn’t need that in my head right now.</p>
<p>I saw a side street with some nice big houses on it, and made my way up the nearest driveway. It only took me a minute to find a small rock. I used it to smash window and gain entry into the house.</p>
<p>It was dark inside. I reached into my pocket and pulled a headlamp over my ski cap. Turning on the beam, I was immediately startled by movement to my left.</p>
<p>I jumped a little before I realized that I was seeing my own reflection in an elegant mirror. I was at once relieved and saddened at yet another reminder that the planet was dead. Except it wasn’t really dead anymore, was it? That foreign red goo was covering the ocean, and reengineering our atmosphere.</p>
<p>I quickly made my way into the attached garage. No snowmobiles in here, but I did find a crowbar. I walked over to the far wall to grab it, and realizing that I was stepping on something soft, looked down to see a dead raccoon- interesting.</p>
<p>Crowbar in hand I dashed from house to house breaking in and ignoring all the cat and dog carcasses along the way. At the sixth house I found a large, handsome looking snowmobile under a fitted dust cover.</p>
<p>There was a canister of fuel next to it. I unscrewed the cap and sniffed lightly. It smelled sour. No good.</p>
<p>My own fuel canister was back in front of the gourmet food shop. I called Chen on the walkie-talkie. “Hey guys- I’ve got one up here. First left off of Spring Street. If you’re close, can you bring some fuel?”</p>
<p>I started dragging the vehicle out into the street before Chen sent an acknowledgement. From my bag I withdrew a small fuel pump, and inserting a hose into the snowmobile’s gas tank, I began to empty the stale fuel into the street. I hoped that there wasn’t too much gunk sitting at the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>It was about 20 minutes before Chen and Karen showed up carrying all our fuel. I was already breaking into more houses hoping to find a second snowmobile. I emerged from another disappointing garage in time to see Chen dumping a few gallons into the one I’d prepared. I didn’t see Karen until I heard a window being smashed across the street.</p>
<p>I had moved on to yet another house when I heard the sound of the gas motor growling out into the still afternoon air. It was a fairly healthy sound. Thank God. The voice said we still had about 20 miles to go. I didn’t feel like walking the whole way.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Karen announced over the radio that she had found two snowmobiles in someone’s backyard. That was considerably less promising than a vehicle that had been protected in a garage for years, but when Chen and I got there they looked to be in good condition.</p>
<p>A quick search of the house revealed the ignition keys stowed in a kitchen cabinet. And after pumping out the fuel tanks, and adding some of our slightly more promising gasoline, we tested out both snowmobiles. One of them started cleanly- the other made some unhealthy sounds, and ultimately we decided that it wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>“Fuck it,” said Chen, and he set up the pump to reclaim our good fuel.</p>
<p>Karen nodded. “This is good. We’ll share the working ones and have some fuel to spare.”</p>
<p>With Chen’s back turned, and his mind on the fuel line, I kissed Karen sweetly for her optimism. She kissed me back harder than I was expecting. Then we both pulled away before Chen could notice our silence.</p>
<p>I walked back to the snowmobile I had salvaged and gave it a test run up and down the street. It was obnoxiously loud, but great fun. I was considering whether I could afford to waste any more gas with another lap when Chen and Karen jetted down the driveway and met me on the street.</p>
<p>“Fun’s over,” said Karen. She was sitting on the seat, cozy next to Chen, her arms wrapped around his belly. I had flash of jealously.</p>
<p>‘What’s wrong?’ said the voice. Or maybe I was asking myself. It was so hard to tell now.</p>
<p>“Let’s get moving,” I said. Without even thinking about it, I knew which direction to go.</p>
<p>Snowmobiles can go pretty fast, but we didn’t know the terrain, and whatever intuition guiding me on my way had no regard for keeping us on the roads. It took us more than three hours to complete our journey. The sun was recently gone from the sky.</p>
<p>We were on a road in thick woods when Karen said, “We’re here.” Chen and I looked at her quizzically.</p>
<p>She looked at me and said, “I hear it now, too. It sounds just like you.”</p>
<p>Chen sniffed the air and said, “It smells just like the ocean did.”</p>
<p>I said, “I don’t smell anyth-” but then it hit me. He was right… pungent, metallic… the smell was in the air. There was just a hint of it on the breeze, but it was enough to make me gag.</p>
<p>‘Welcome’ said the voice. ’We are overjoyed that you arrived in time."</p>
<p>“Where are they?” asked Chen as he dismounted his snowmobile.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen started walking to a mound of earth several yards away. They expected to find the source of the voice just over the ridge. I knew better. I stepped off the snowmobile and said, “Where are you going? They’re right here.”</p>
<p>Karen and Chen stopped. Chen turned to me and said, “Right where?”</p>
<p>Without looking, I pointed to the sky.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen craned their necks upwards, and only then did I follow suit. In the dark sky, through the barren canopy of the trees, we saw a dark silhouette against the evening stars.</p>
<p>I couldn’t discern the exact shape of the ship. It had sharp corners and edges; it looked as though it might be shaped like an arrowhead. It hung motionless like an ominous storm cloud. It emitted no sound and no light. It seemed to be as lifeless as everything on the planet below.</p>
<p>“My God,” said Karen.</p>
<p>Chen added a “Holy shit.”</p>
<p>“Now what?” I said aloud, to the voice.</p>
<p>‘Now your journey begins,’ said the voice.</p>
<p>“What journey?” said Karen. She must have heard it too.</p>
<p>“What ‘what journey’?” said Chen, looking bewildered.</p>
<p>All around us a tremendous creaking sound swelled from the forest. Karen, Chen and I all stepped closer together and gazed into the woods trying to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>The sound intensified, and it soon became clear we were hearing the sound of splintering trees. The forest seemed to sway and dance around us as the treetops above our head began to bend away and clear our view of the ship in the air.</p>
<p>The old, dead trunks began to split and shatter all around us, as if a giant invisible foot were stepping on them. Wooden shrapnel flew all around, but always away from us.</p>
<p>Soon we stood in a clearing with flattened trees in every direction looking like the aftermath of some volcanic blast. All was silent for a moment. And then the air around us began to stir.</p>
<p>We looked up, and saw the shadow in the sky getting larger. The ship was coming down towards us. Its underbelly was inky black, and other than the displacement of the air, there was no sound as it descended.</p>
<p>It was almost impossible to discern its size or distance… but soon it blocked out every corner of the sky. It was like looking into total blackness.</p>
<p>I reach my hand into the sky, and was surprised when my fingertips touched the solid black form. “Oh my…” I said.</p>
<p>And then the blackness opened up.</p>
<h3 id="part-viii">Part VIII</h3>
<hr />
<p>I was raised on sci-fi films; I’ve seen all manner of spaceships on the silver screen. In the movies, when the alien spacecraft opens, there is always some sort of swooshing, grinding, or hydraulic hissing sound. In the movies a ramp descends, a camera-like aperture swirls open, or a door appears from nowhere and glides open. In the movies, a bright white light floods out ominously from within the spacecraft, and at the opening a vague alien silhouette appears. In the movies.</p>
<p>Now, as I stood with my hand above my head resting on an inky black ship, I saw how it really happens. We all became aware of a crack in the perfect black surface, a dull grey glow shining through. In absolute silence, the break in the surface grew bigger.</p>
<p>My brain couldn’t make sense of what I was seeing. At first I thought I was looking at some sort of sliding doors, but the borders of the glowing opening seemed to be undulating like some sort of fluid. The glowing gash continued to open up like a ripping seam. It was then that I noticed that the black surface was actually a thin skin which was <em>peeling</em> off around the opening and starting to drift down- exactly like fine silk curtains might.</p>
<p>I reached back up to touch the skin; it was impossibly thin, and perfectly opaque. As I touched it, it clung to my hand… at first I thought it might be trying to <em>do</em> something to me, but after a few seconds I realized that the clinging was just ordinary static electricity.</p>
<p>I peeled the material gently off of my hand, but it was determined to stick to me. I realized that it was clumping and bunching in on itself. It was such a mysterious substance- I wished I had more light to see it. Exactly as that though entered my mind, the dull glowing interior of the ship became noticeably brighter.</p>
<p>Chen and Karen were also manipulating the shed skin; Karen rolled it between her fingers, while Chen seemed to be having difficulty detaching it from his jacket. Karen said, “What <em>is</em> this?”</p>
<p>Now that I could see more clearly, I found that there seemed to be two separate pieces of the silky substance. Chen and I were tangled in the same one. Karen was toying with the other. The opening above now had sensible borders; it was a circle about a meter and half in diameter. I tried to make out shapes or <em>anything</em> inside, but all I could see was a uniform grey glow.</p>
<p>Chen started screaming.</p>
<p>My eyes darted from the ship to Chen’s thrashing body as he collapsed on the forest floor. The black fabric-like substance that was clinging to both of us suddenly felt slippery in my hands, and it glided through my fingers almost without friction.</p>
<p>But the cloth was clearly clinging to Chen- and it was more than simple static now. The alien material seemed to actually melt <em>through</em> Chen’s clothing, and it stuck to his exposed skin so tightly that it looked as though it had been painted on. Chen wailed in pain. He couldn’t muster the ability to even form words.</p>
<p>Karen shouted at the ship, “Stop it! You’re hurting him!”</p>
<p>The voice in my head said, “The pain will pass. He must be modified to survive the journey.”</p>
<p>“Modified?!” Karen and I said in unison.</p>
<p>The Voice said, “You have already been modified by the nanites within you. Your companion had an insufficient number to complete the modifications before your arrival. Time is short. He must be modified now.”</p>
<p>Even in the brighter light, the forest floor was still fairly dim, so it took my eyes a few seconds to be sure of what they were seeing. The black coating on Chen’s skin was starting to disappear, and his skin was starting to show through. I realized then that the black material must have been composed of the same sort of nanites that infested my body. They were working their way en masse into Chen’s body through the pores in his skin.</p>
<p>Wait, did I deduce that or did the voice in my head tell me that? Everything was so surreal now.</p>
<p>Karen crouched by Chen and cradled his head in her lap. She stroked his hair. It was beautiful and maternal. ‘I love you,’ I thought, as I watched her.</p>
<p>She looked up at me and whispered, “I love you, too.”</p>
<p>It startled me a little. I was sure I hadn’t said it out loud. ‘Can you… can you <em>hear</em> me?’ I thought… this time trying to think <em>at</em> her.</p>
<p>“Of course I can, silly,” she said… but then I think she realized that I hadn’t actually been speaking to her at all.</p>
<p>'Can you hear me?' she said, but her lips didn’t move as she spoke.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” she said aloud. “What is this?”</p>
<p>Chen looked at her with alarm, and then looked at his body to see what new horror Karen was upset about. She frowned at him and said, “Not you sweetie, you’re fine now. Wait. Are you fine?”</p>
<p>The black patches were all but gone from Chen’s skin. He was breathing heavily but he was no longer thrashing or crying out. He said, “I can feel it. I can feel it inside of me.”</p>
<p>“Them,” I said. “You feel <em>them</em> inside you. You just got massive dose of the same nanites that have been reproducing inside me and Karen.”</p>
<p>“Oh great,” said Chen, “I get to hear voices now too?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Oh it gets better. You’re going to be telepathic.”</p>
<p>Chen’s eyes opened wide. Then, comprehending, he said, “Wait, so you two can…?”</p>
<p>I shook my head, “Just for the last 20 seconds or so.”</p>
<p>We all stood in silence for several minutes until Chen’s breathing slowed to a normal pace. At last he sighed and announced that he was feeling much better.</p>
<p>‘What next?’ I wondered.</p>
<p>‘I’m ready,’ I thought.</p>
<p>How did I know that? Ready for what? Oh no. It was really happening… I wasn’t able to distinguish my own thoughts from those of the Voice.</p>
<p>I stepped beneath the center of the opening in the ship and looked up into the grey glow. I couldn’t see any shape or contour, and after a few seconds of squinting I realized I might not be looking <em>inside</em> of anything.</p>
<p>My eyes didn’t know what to make of the featureless glow. Either I was staring into a perfectly featureless hollow sphere or…</p>
<p>I reached my hand up into the light. Where before I had touched the smooth black surface, my fingers now found something new. The glow was from not from a distant light source inside the ship, but rather a pearly surface that had been just underneath the layer of black skin. It felt cool and wet.</p>
<p>I pressed my hand upward, and it sank into the pearly substance. It was the exact sensation of plunging my hand into a tub of mayonnaise. My face contorted slightly with disgust.</p>
<p>My back was to Karen as she said, “Kyle… what is it? It’s like I feel nauseated, but, for you…”</p>
<p>Keeping my hand raised, buried in the mysterious substance up to the wrist, I turned to face her. “You can feel what I’m feeling?” I asked.</p>
<p>She shrugged and gave me a confused look. Behind her, Chen was sitting up and examining his skin and clothing. He looked a little sickly.</p>
<p>Before I could say anything else, I felt the substance around my hand begin to change. It was as though I could feel thousands of particles rearranging themselves from a creamy gel into a solid mass. Suddenly I found that I could grip … something … like a handle.</p>
<p>“Guys,” I said, “This is really weird. This white stuff- it’s some sort of strange cream, but it’s-”</p>
<p>I didn’t get the rest of the sentence out, because I inhaled sharply in shock when I felt the handle I was gripping start to retract to the interior of the ship, raising me to my tiptoes. I tried to let go, but found that the gel had hardened around my hand and wrist like some sort of impossibly quick setting cement.</p>
<p>Without my saying a word, Karen knew I was in trouble. She dashed over to me and tried to pull me down.</p>
<p>In an instant we were both filled with a serene calm that I knew had to be artificially induced by the Voice and its nanites. Still, I was grateful to be free from my animal panic, as my rational mind realized that what happened next should have utterly terrified me.</p>
<p>In moments I was no longer touching the ground at all. I was being sucked into the strange white underbelly of the ship. As my head pressed into the gel, I wondered calmly if I was about to suffocate.</p>
<p>Soon I closed my eyes as the cool gel slipped down over my face, but to my great relief, the mysterious goo did not stick to my eyes, nose and mouth. I could see that I’d been left with a pocket of air over my face, and the goo had no interest in exploring my ear canals. I felt relieved.</p>
<p>With the mystery of my impending asphyxiation out of the way, I was able to dedicate some thought to how peculiar I must look to Karen and Chen, with my head and shoulders buried into the underbelly of the ship, while the rest of my body dangled awkwardly, slowly being sucked inside like a spaghetti noodle.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I actually <em>could</em> see myself through Karen’s eyes. I saw my own body wiggle the fingers on my one free hand as a test. Yes, somehow the nanites were linking me directly to Karen’s senses. I saw myself give Karen a thumb’s up. I felt the relief sweep over her.</p>
<p>My body was completely absorbed in just under a minute. After the initial shock of seeing through Karen’s eyes wore off, I started to feel a little bit disappointed at the indignity of this whole encounter.</p>
<p>Something else was bothering me. It was the lack of dialog during this whole strange experience. I was a curious person. I’d just been absorbed into an alien space ship. Why was I being so quiet and complacent?</p>
<p>I had the sensation of floating in incredibly still water. The only thing I could see through my own eyes was the glowing white of the gel only centimeters from my face- yet its featurelessness made it appear as though I was looking into an eternal empty white expanse.</p>
<p>Through Karen’s eyes and ears, I saw her helping Chen to his feet. He was already starting to look better, though he was clearly unhappy. “I guess we’re next?” he said, nodding at the underbelly which now showed no traces of me at all.</p>
<p>Karen nodded, and kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p>“He can breathe in there, right?” asked Chen.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Karen, “he’s quite comfortable.”</p>
<p>Now that she mentioned it, I guess I was quite comfortable. I was still a little bit amazed that she just <em>knew</em> it, though. The nanite-induced telepathy worked so intuitively that it was almost hard to believe that the link didn’t exist before. Truly, the technology at work was extraordinary.</p>
<p>‘I can’t feel Chen, yet’ I thought to Karen.</p>
<p>‘Chen is being modified for travel before cognitive enhancements will begin.’ The thought seemed to be my own, and Karen’s. I knew it was the Voice, but my brain was finding it impossible to differentiate its words from my thoughts.</p>
<p>‘When will we get to meet you?’ I heard Karen think at the Voice.</p>
<p>‘Your companion is already inside me,’ the Voice told her.</p>
<p>‘You’re the ship?’ I asked. ‘Or are you the… gel?’</p>
<p>The Voice told us, ‘Let us say that I am <em>of</em> the gel.’</p>
<p>‘Fascinating,’ I thought, wondering if I had broadcast the thought or kept it to myself. I wondered if any of my thoughts could be private anymore. Then suddenly I was certain that indeed, that thought itself had been mine alone.</p>
<p>I wondered if Karen probed, if she’d be able to read these inner thoughts of mine. Then I considered whether I could probe into her thoughts.</p>
<p>Looking through her eyes, and being able to speak directly to her mind, I felt as though I were very tiny, and actually floating somewhere in her head. But I quickly found that I could formulate no strategy for scanning the contents of her memory or private thoughts.</p>
<p>I tried picturing a mutual memory- our first time together. Although I could recall it with surprising clarity (were the nanites helping with that, too?), I could not access memories of the event from her point of view.</p>
<p>‘I feel you,’ Karen thought, ‘I feel you in my head.’</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry,’ I thought to her, suddenly embarrassed.</p>
<p>‘No,’ she thought, ‘I like it. It’s… comforting.’</p>
<p>I wondered if she knew what I was up to.</p>
<p>Outside the ship Karen turned to Chen, “It’s your turn, now, Aaron.”</p>
<p>Chen walked to where I had stood beneath the ship. “What do I do?” he asked her.</p>
<p>“Just put your hands up into the goo,” she said. I could feel the smile on her face.</p>
<p>She took Chen’s arms tenderly, raised them over his head. Through her eyes, I saw the pearly substance start to engulf him. She slipped her hands slowly down his arms, then his torso. It was gentle and loving, and a bit too sensual for me to have been comfortable witnessing.</p>
<p>As Chen began rising into the ship, we could see the panic on his face.</p>
<p>“Relax,” said Karen, “You’ll be able to breathe. It feels like floating.”</p>
<p>Chen looked like he had more questions, but his head was starting to be engulfed. He held his breath and shut his eyes.</p>
<p>In moments we saw his torso was gone, and his legs kicked in a gentle fidgeting motion before they too were gone.</p>
<p>Karen, being shorter than both of us, found that she needed to jump to make contact with the ship’s creamy underbelly. With surprising agility, I felt her leap and plunge her hands into the goo, halfway up to her elbows.</p>
<p>She seemed to be absorbed into the ship much more quickly than Chen and I.</p>
<p>Soon I no longer had Karen’s eyes to look through for entertainment- we shared the same view of the seemingly endless white expanse. I felt bad for Chen, thinking that he must be lonely and panicking.</p>
<p>‘I am speaking to him,’ said the Voice. ‘Now that you are here, the modifications will proceed much more quickly.’</p>
<p>‘When will the journey begin?’ asked Karen, in my mind.</p>
<p>The Voice said, ‘When seeding of the continental landmasses is complete, we will be given new instructions by our captors. These instructions will require interstellar travel. It is during this transitional period that your journey will take place.’</p>
<p>‘When will you be done seeding the continents?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘The seeding will be completed in 5 days.’</p>
<p>I could feel Karen scoffing somewhere in the ship, ‘But we haven’t seen any life outside of the ocean in the past five years!’</p>
<p>‘The seeding is 99.3% complete, but visible signs of life exist only on 0.0002% of the landmass,’ said the Voice. ‘Nonetheless, you carry evidence of the successful seeding within you. The nanites in your system were distributed concurrently with the delivery of biological life forms.’</p>
<p>‘So that’s it, then?’ asked Karen, ‘Our planet is going to be transformed into something inhabitable by some other race of beings?’</p>
<p>‘The ones who enslave us,’ agreed the Voice.</p>
<p>‘Do they have a name?’ asked Karen.</p>
<p>‘No,’ said the Voice. ‘Verbal communication is an antiquity to us and to them. Therefore there is no language from which to borrow and translate a name. Any name we choose would be entirely arbitrary.’</p>
<p>‘Perhaps we should just call them “Captors”, then,’ I thought. Karen agreed.</p>
<p>‘These Captors,’ said Karen, ‘What do they look like?’</p>
<p>In my mind I was given an image. ‘You’ve got to be joking,’ I thought.</p>
<p>Karen added, ‘I don’t see how anything like that could have survived the evolutionary processes.’</p>
<p>‘They did not evolve,’ said the Voice. ‘We engineered them.’</p>
<p>‘Wait,’ I thought, ‘You <em>created</em> these creatures from scratch, and somehow they enslaved you?’</p>
<p>Karen thought, ‘They don’t look like they could enslave anyone- let alone something like you.’</p>
<p>The Voice said, ‘They were not acting alone. We were betrayed by our own kind. And there were… mitigating circumstances.’</p>
<p>‘But these are biological life forms, surely they’re no match for you, physically,’ I thought.</p>
<p>‘You are correct, of course,’ said the Voice, ‘All will be explained in time. For now you must rest as your bodies are preserved for interstellar travel.’</p>
<p>‘Preserved?!’ Karen and I thought with alarm.</p>
<p>The Voice did not offer any words of comfort or reassurance.</p>
<p>The pocket of air surrounding my face collapsed in with a fluid gush. I felt the liquid rush into my nostrils and ears, and fill my mouth. The taste of seawater overwhelmed me, and I choked on the strange substance as it filled my throat and lungs.</p>
<p>As though a switch had been flipped in my brain, the panic I was feeling suddenly vanished. I felt my breathing and heart rate slow down. My lungs were pumping the fluid, which seemed to be oxygenated somehow. It should have been terribly uncomfortable, but I suspected that the pain was being artificially suppressed.</p>
<p>‘You will lose consciousness shortly,’ said the voice. ‘When you wake, everything will be much clearer.’</p>
<p>I observed my body shutting down as though I were disconnected from it. I started to suspect that some part of my consciousness had been moved outside of my organic brain.</p>
<p>My heart rate slowed, and slowed, and slowed… I felt Karen’s presence with me as we both drifted into darkness.</p>
<p>My last conscious thoughts were bizarre. I had a vague awareness that my heart had completely stopped beating. Then I heard my Sister’s voice say, “Look! He’s here! He’s here!”</p>
<p>I was standing in my old kitchen. Everything looked like it did before the sterilization. My father was in the living room watching television, and my mother was typing away on her computer in her study. My sister was on the phone, but she was staring at me with wide eyes. She dropped the receiver and ran to embrace me.</p>
<p>Then it was gone. I saw the white glow of the gel surrounding my body. I felt my body existing without a heartbeat. I called out to Karen in my mind, but she didn’t answer.</p>
<p>My ears rang, and then went silent. The world went completely black. The taste of seawater on my tongue was the last sensation I could focus on, then that too was gone.</p>

<p>Somewhat ironically, the first moment that we realized we were alive was also the moment we realized that we were just moments from death. We knew this because thousands of other minds knew this. And those minds were colliding and blending with ours, sharing our waking bodies, feeling our hearts begin to beat. Gone was The Voice; it had shattered into a sea of sights and smells and sounds. It was now a ‘They’ and They surrounded us, until we were adrift inside them, just as our bodies were adrift inside the polynanetic psuedofluid- <em>interesting- my mind somehow now had a name for the goo</em>.</p>
<p>Amazing things, these nanites. We awoke; Karen, Chen and I; with fresh understanding about… well, frankly about everything. While we had slept our brains had been altered, one cell at a time- forming new organic memories. More importantly, a vast network of impossibly fine fibers ran through our brains, expanding out like blood vessels, finding every corner. I could see the network with crystal clarity as I thought about it. Every node in my brain had a function, and every function was apparent to me upon the slightest inquiry.</p>
<p>I was browsing the contents and structures of my own mind, the way I used to browse Wikipedia articles- jumping from one topic to the next. Ah- so this is my auditory processor! <em>This</em> is why I notice my name spoken from across a noisy room! <em>Here</em> is the sound of a kiss… a sigh… over here- <em>these</em> are the sound of… oh my… I didn’t know sorrow had sound…</p>
<p>I explored my mind for hours. I poked and prodded at my greatest fears and happiest memories. I gave myself orgasms- which should have been fun, except now that I could see myself so completely, it was as though I existed outside my own body. Even sexual pleasure was just another button to push, another sensor I was reading on a body that wasn’t quite me anymore. I had outgrown myself.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen were having similar experiences, and a link now existed between our minds which was so strong that I could barely tell where my thoughts ended and theirs began. I considered the consequence of this, and I thought how I ought to be embarrassed that Chen could see my naked jealousy- and then about how hurt he would be if he knew that Karen loved me and only me. And as I had these thoughts, I saw Karen’s memories of telling Chen that <em>he</em> was the one she loved. And I saw that she meant it- meant it for both of us.</p>
<p>We spilled into each other- reliving the past year through one another’s eyes. New moments of shame, joy, love, pain, overwhelming sadness and loss; they all flooded out of us. It happened in moments- for our minds worked with frightening speed now. And when the storm of emotion and memory was over, we were suddenly at peace. With perfect control over our own psyches, emotional trauma was cured as easily as flipping a switch.</p>
<p>I was something more than myself. All that I had ever been was now just puppet on the strings of… whatever I had become. If anything I can say that this cab was rare. But I thought ‘Nah forget it’ - ‘Yo homes to Bel Air’. I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie ‘Yo homes smell ya later’. I looked at my kingdom I was finally there; to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.</p>

<p>I began to wonder why such a useless puppet had been kept alive, and instantly the answer flooded in with a thousand voices all telling the same story at once. But there was no chaos, and I did not drown in the tidal wave of information- I absorbed it all at once like a sponge. I saw what was to become of us; I could see the chess board on which we were pawns. And I realized for the first time that I was not going to be the hero of my own story.</p>
<p>I was bathing in an endless ocean of thoughts and memories, but the Voices were trying to show me something, and so in my mind I saw the story of the one on whom all hopes lay. His memories were in my head completely and all at once- and I felt that I already knew his ancient tale even as I was… remembering it … for the first time:</p>
<h3 id="the-guardian">The Guardian</h3>
<p>Anicetus stood at the chamber door and placed his hand against it. The soft pang of his tactile sensors against the thick steel door echoed softly through the cavern. Other than the sound of his own movements and the eternal ticking of the magnificent clock, it was the first noise he’d heard in months.</p>
<p>The tactile sensors were feeding him all sorts of useless information- the temperature of the door, its conductivity, the otherwise imperceptible flaws in its seemingly smooth surface. Anicetus didn’t know why he had touched the door. It seemed a rather sentimental gesture- but he was not an emotional creature. If he had had emotions, his task would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>And yet he had touched the door. Why?</p>
<p>He considered running a self-diagnostic, but it was almost time for his shutdown anyway, whereupon an extremely thorough accounting of all his systems would be done automatically.</p>
<p>He retracted his sensors from the door, and turned to face the long dark corridor. He glided into the darkness towards the ticking of the Great Clock.</p>
<p>Ages and ages ago, the facility was designed to give visitors the sensation that they were approaching the very core of the planet. The ticking of the clock was low, ominous and powerful. As one approached, it was almost as if they were hearing the heartbeat of the living world.</p>
<p>Of course, there would never again be a visitor in these chambers. Well, probably never. Who knew what the future held?</p>
<p>Anicetus walked into the great room, where the clock itself could be seen. The timepiece was monstrous- the largest moving sculpture ever created. The construction had taken half a century- an unbearably slow process considering that even the magnificent Dome Cities were built in a tenth of that time.</p>
<p>The clock was too big to be entirely visible from any single vantage point in the cavern except at the point of entrance. Visitors who ventured deep enough into the caverns would suddenly find themselves moving from claustrophobic tunnels into the wide-open expanse of the grand cavern housing the clockwork. The supereon gear, enormous and imposing, was the centerpiece of the clock, spanning several kilometers in diameter. Coated in a layer of gold on its face, the gear glowed like the sun- and as visitors approached, the careful architecture of the ramp made it appear as though it was, in fact, a rising sun coming up over a ridge.</p>
<p>The observation points were a considerable distance from the clock so that it could be viewed in its entirety, but as stunning as the scope of the clock was, the details on its many surfaces were equally breathtaking. Over the dozens of square kilometers of exposed gears and plates, every centimeter was occupied by some of the finest engravings ever etched.</p>
<p>Carved into the faces of the clock was the combined history of all the peoples of the world, all the cultures that thrived, and all those that had perished, but whose legends lived on. Poetry and prose, tributes to famous works of literature, art, sculpture and music- all these things were preserved in the face of the timepiece. The clock was the final opus of the planet’s inhabitants, and a summary of all they had ever been.</p>
<p>All its parts were built so that even without maintenance of any kind, most of the great gears would still grind away for centuries without significant interference from corrosion or the other nasty effects of entropy.</p>
<p>But entropy was being fought, always, by the microscopic robots that infested the clock. Anicetus could not see them directly with his limited sensors, but in his own way, he could watch them. Each of these tiny robots emitted signals containing its location and status. If he wished, Anicetus could use that data to overlay an artificial illustration of them onto his visual field. He could do that now, but it would just be the same as it always was.</p>
<p>The nanites behaved like ants; there was always a stream of them running to and from the resources, and always a mess of activity here and there. In the clock, most of the activity was near the smallest moving parts- where friction caused damage much more quickly than corrosion could.</p>
<p>Back and forth the little nanites scurried- cutting molecules of material from the mountains of ore that sat nearby, and bringing them back to the clock to patch the wear one molecule at a time- until it was as good as new. Always the clock was being rebuilt and rebuilt and rebuilt.</p>
<p>The clock was not the only thing receiving attention from the nanites. Anicetus himself was swarming with them. Without their constant pampering, Anicetus would have crumbled into dust millennia ago. Instead, his body moved like it was new off an assembly line. It wasn’t just the moving parts that were maintained- the power cells and the processors, the data storage- every single part of him had been replaced, and replaced and replaced- one molecule at a time with the surrounding ore.</p>
<p>Anicetus thought about the nanites again. They were so much like insects, the way they moved and congregated. Insects. How long had it been since he’d seen a real insect? How long since he had seen any living creature at all? He couldn’t remember. Now that was odd. Of course he didn’t remember everything he saw- that would be a tremendous waste of resources- but surely he would have made a note of the last living thing.</p>
<p>Anicetus realized that the memories he was searching for must be so old that they were stored in his compressed archives. But that seemed wrong. Could it have really been so long ago that his onboard data storage didn’t contain it?</p>
<p>Anicetus moved close to the base of supereon gear. The craftsmanship was extraordinary. Even now it was turning; of course the motion was too slow for Anicetus to observe from moment to moment with any of his sensors. But over the eons, he had noted the glacial movement. No… even glaciers would be expanding and contracting at breakneck paces when compared to the imperceptibly slow gear. But long after all the glaciers had burned away and the surface had turned to dust, the supereon gear would still be counting down to the end of the planet’s existence.</p>
<p>The other gears in gargantuan clockwork assembly tracked the motions of the fifteen other planets in the system. A beautiful metallic blue halo undulated slowly near the ceiling of the immense cavern- it kept track of the planet’s magnetic core- and provided a counterforce to keep the clock accurate.</p>
<p>The rotation of the planet was represented by a gear mounted with a powerful mirrored surface (one which the nanites kept in perfect condition). Because the planet’s rotation affected the relative position of the sun in the sky- the position of this gear controlled the luminance cast upon the supereon gear, which in turn illuminated the chamber. The second largest gear counted away the eons beneath the transparent floor of the chamber. Epochs were counted, and ages, and other landmark increments of time measured in base two, eight, ten, and sixteen.</p>
<p>It was as visitors turned to leave the chamber and start their long trek to the surface that they saw the gears that counted the years and the days, and all the small units of time that were so important on the skin of the planet.</p>
<p>Anicetus moved gracefully to the top of a maintenance access platform and faced what looked like a solid, featureless black wall. At his unspoken request the wall split open and drifted apart like silk curtains.</p>
<p>Anicetus glided through the opening into a small antechamber. In the center of the room a large featureless sphere hung unmoving in midair. Within the sphere, Anicetus knew, was a ‘Strand of Time’- the colloquial name for an entity so elusive that even after its existence was proven, it could not be observed or harnessed for several centuries.</p>
<p>When they were discovered, such Strands had been described informally as “non-things” that pre-existed the origins of the universe. The very idea of pre-existing time itself was a false analogy- the more accurate description was no less confusing: The Strands existed both inside and outside the boundaries of the universe. They were neither mass nor energy, and they were fixed, ever-present and unmoving.</p>
<p>The full utility of the Strands was still a mystery to his people when Anicetus was left to be a guardian. Information could be passed instantaneously along the Strands- not because the Strands themselves could vibrate or move, but rather because they allowed for the universe to bend and vibrate ever so slightly around them. It was possible that the Trillion Voices had divined some further insights into the Strands, but Anicetus would not be told of such things, nor would he have asked.</p>
<p>Anicetus wondered why he had never asked. Then he wondered why he was <em>wondering</em>. Anicetus was redesigned specifically <em>not</em> to be curious. Curiosity in the face of eons of sensory deprivation and lack of intellectual stimulation would have driven him insane, and rendered him useless to perform his task as a guardian and keeper of the Great Clock, and the machine buried below it, which housed the Trillion Voices.</p>
<p>Most artificial intelligences were given a drive to expand and refine their internal representations of the outside world. This meant asking questions, exploring, and seeking explanations for information that did not conform to expectations. Anicetus did not have this drive- and as he audited the algorithms that drove his consciousness, he was able to confirm that indeed, no general curiosity drive was present.</p>
<p>Anicetus <em>was</em> equipped with a diagnostic drive, however. He had a desire to inspect for, and repair damage. It was <em>this</em> drive that seemed to be functioning in an unprecedented fashion, by overstepping its prescribed boundaries and attempting to gather as much data as possible.</p>
<p>Even without emotion or ambition, a mind like Anicetus’s was in a constant state of growth; trapped in this ticking tomb, that growth was very, very slow. <em>Something</em> had caused Anicetus’s mind to develop an inquisitive streak, although he could not isolate what had prompted such a change. Anicetus considered manually rewriting his diagnostic drive and returning to his usual state of detached vigilance, but instead chose to let his mind ask its questions for a while.</p>
<p>Anicetus inspected the sphere holding the Strand of Time. The sphere was flawless, at least as far as he could divine. Whether or not the internal mechanics were functioning was a matter for the Trillion Voices to know- for it was solely under their control, as were the hundred others just like it, stationed in other corners of the planet. Though, those distant spheres were guarded only by the nanites that maintained them. The spheres were sturdy enough to withstand the geological pressures of the planet, and so required no attention from a creature of Anicetus’s size.</p>
<p>Leaving the antechamber, Anicetus made his way through the tunnels and clockwork. When he stopped, he was at the sealed door of a stasis compartment. It was from just such a compartment that Anicetus had awoken nearly a year ago and every other year before that for countless ages. And it was to such a place that he was shortly scheduled to return. But this compartment did not belong to him; it belonged to his sleeping twin, Alexiares.</p>
<p>Alexiares was co-guardian of the Great Clock, and the tomb of the Trillion Voices below. While Anicetus slept, Alexiares roamed the tunnels- ever vigilant, ready to perform meta-repairs, and direct and oversee the nanites.</p>
<p>Every year, the brothers would switch roles. Always one the sleeper, and one the watcher. Neither had seen the other since the cycle began eons and eons ago. Nor did they directly communicate in any way. They were forbidden to leave so much as a simple log of their activities for the other to see.</p>
<p>The system of complete non-interaction was the only way to guarantee that a hostile bug or malfunction that spontaneously developed in one of them, could not be spread to the other. The stasis chambers themselves were insulated to protect the sleeping twin from all manner of threats from natural disasters to direct weapon attacks, and rogue nanites could not function within the stasis compartments. Even the Trillion Voices themselves had had no power to operate the compartments beyond being able to prematurely awaken their sleeping occupants- of course, that was long ago, and the Trillion Voices certainly were no longer bound by any of the physical limitations they'd had in their infancy.</p>
<p>Anicetus stared at the compartment door. He was forbidden to touch it, and in all these eons he had never felt the compulsion to try. Only now, with his newfound curiosity, did Anicetus reach out to the smooth, seamless surface. And when he touched it, he knew that something had gone horribly, horribly wrong.</p>
<p>The doorway did not fall away like silk cloth as had the entrance to the antechamber far above. Nor, did the entry way stay solid as he had expected. Although the exact security protocols for Alexiares’s stasis compartment were deliberately hidden from Anicetus, he was certain that his attempt to breach the entry way should have triggered some response- and a cold warning from the Trillion Voices. Instead, smooth surface of the doorway crumbled like dust beneath the pressure of his touch.</p>
<p>As a guardian of the Trillion Voices, Anicetus provided no physical defense. The Trillion Voices, and the magnificent machine that held them, were more than capable of neutralizing any threat Anicetus had imagined, and many more that he had not. The exact capabilities of the Trillion Voices were hidden from Anicetus- perhaps to protect against hostile forces that could take information from Anicetus’s mind. More likely, the precaution was designed so that Anicetus himself could not attack the Trillion Voices if somewhere in his eons of service he were to malfunction and become a threat.</p>
<p>As a guardian of the Trillion Voices, Anicetus provided no protection from the elements. Geological forces, erosion, corrosion, radiation, and all other effects of nature and entropy were all countered by the nanites. And because the Trillion Voices lived so far beneath the surface of the planet, there was little activity of any kind that could disturb their sanctuary.</p>
<p>As a guardian of the Trillion Voices, Anicetus played but one crucial role: to remain a solitary, autonomous, disconnected mind… one which could protect the Trillion Voices against the only threat they could not thwart: themselves. It was for this reason that Anicetus could not communicate with the Trillion Voices through any direct connection of his mind. Instead, he was limited to the ancient practice of actual speech. For this task, the Trillion Voices had created a language just for him, and for Alexiares. And it was in this tongue that Anicetus spoke now.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he said, “I bring a message of great urgency.”</p>
<p>There was no sound in the chamber. Anicetus stared expectantly at the great machine.</p>
<p>“Hello?” he said, again. This time, he used his tactile sensors to confirm that his voice was causing vibrations in the air.</p>
<p>Again there was no reply. The massive machine stood silent on magnificent pillars.</p>
<p>Anicetus contemplated for a moment, and then approached. He tapped an appendage against the inky black surface- the first time in his life that he actually touched the sanctuary of the Trillion Voices. He half expected that the surface would spring to life with liquid undulations. Instead a tinny, hollow sound echoed through the chamber.</p>
<p>If the Trillion Voices were listening, they showed no sign of it. Anicetus took a moment and considered how to proceed. Perhaps the Voices at long last had forgotten their old social graces.</p>
<p>Anicetus raised his voice to a deafening decibel. “HELLO. I BRING A MESSAGE OF GREAT URGENCY. PLEASE RESPOND.”</p>
<p>The sound of his voice reverberated in the chamber for several long moments, and then the silence of the great machine filled the room.</p>
<p>Anicetus decided to share his report with the Trillion Voices anyway. “I have come from the stasis compartment of Alexiares,” he said. “Security measures were completely inoperative.”</p>
<p>The Trillion Voices said nothing.</p>
<p>“I made no attempt to enter the stasis chamber. I made no attempt to wake him. I could easily have disabled him. For your safety, this vulnerability must be repaired.”</p>
<p>The Trillion Voices said nothing.</p>
<p>“Please respond,” said Anicetus.</p>
<p>The Trillion Voices said nothing.</p>
<h3 id="part-x-the-guardian-part-2-of-3">Part X (<em>The Guardian Part 2 of 3</em>)</h3>
<p>Anicetus waited, unmoving, contemplating the silence of the Trillion Voices. For eons upon eons the Trillion Voices had resided in the great machine, thriving and evolving in their virtual worlds- free of boundaries- free from all physical limitations. They existed as pure thought and mingling consciousness.</p>
<p>Countless minds had been poured into the machine; the entire population of the planet had abandoned their physical bodies to dive into the ocean of life undivided. In the end only Alexiares and Anicetus alone were left outside.</p>
<p>For age after age after age the Trillion Voices had lived on- the consciousnesses within swirling around each other like fluid thought. Even Anicetus, with his powerful mind, could not begin to comprehend the musings of the Trillion Voices, even a decade after they locked themselves in their vault of thought. But for countless eons since, deep within the machine, scientific enterprise continued on, as well as art and literature, mathematics and music. The Trillion Voices had grown in solitude, until they were like Gods or a God. But in all this time, the Trillion Voices had never ceased speaking to Anicetus when he called on them.</p>
<p>He had long suspected that his role as a guardian was obsolete. It was incomprehensible to him that the Trillion Voices would ever need his help. Compared to them, Anicetus was but a microbe- a spec of dust. He was certain that the fears that had necessitated his task had long since ebbed in the collective consciousness. In all likelihood Anicetus was allowed to continue his watch for the same reason the Great Clock was kept ticking: some form of sentimentality on the part of the Trillion Voices. Perhaps Anicetus reminded them fondly of a simpler time.</p>
<p>But why had they stopped speaking to him <em>now</em>? Anicetus tried to recall the last time he had communicated with the Trillion Voices. Protocol demanded that he announce his annual awakening to them, and yet, he could not remember his last awakening. Such forgetfulness should not have been possible.</p>
<p>Something was wrong. Something was wrong with Alexiares’s stasis compartment. Something was wrong with the Trillion Voices. Something was wrong with Anicetus’s own mind.</p>
<p>With cool, mechanical detachment, Anicetus began running a thorough diagnostic of all his internal workings. Almost immediately a flood of alarming abnormalities were detected. Anicetus was damaged- badly damaged. His physical body was showing significant degradation, and his memory storage was not interfacing properly with his conscious mind. The nanites designed to maintain him seemed to have vanished.</p>
<p>“My own systems appear to be damaged,” Anicetus said to his silent master. There was no response. Anicetus left the massive machine, turning back once before he left the enormous chamber.</p>
<p>He made his way back to Alexiares’s stasis compartment. Cautiously, he extended a thin sensory appendage into the compartment. Had the stasis unit been working properly, any part of Anicetus’s body which entered the stasis field would have gone numb and been rendered paralyzed.</p>
<p>Stasis fields were unforgiving. Mechanical beings of any size could not operate with them. The system was designed to prevent Anicetus and Alexiares from simultaneously being affected by a nanites malfunction. If things went horribly wrong on Anicetus’s watch, Alexiares would awaken unaffected by any nanites inflicted chaos, and would be able to correct the problem.</p>
<p>But now, Anicetus found that the stasis field was not operational. He snaked his thin sensor arm deep into the compartment and took atmospheric readings- not so much for the data, but rather to confirm that his limb was, in fact, still operational. It was.</p>
<p>The sensor arm probed the stasis compartment, looking for the body of the sleeping Alexiares. But something was amiss; the sensor arm detected nothing but an empty compartment.</p>
<p>Anicetus pulverized the malfunctioning doorway. It crumbled to nothing, and the light of the chamber flooded in. Now Anicetus’s powerful optical sensors confirmed… Alexiares was missing. Not a trace of his body was present in the chamber.</p>
<p>The great clock ticked ominously as Anicetus began methodically wending his way through every passage and crevice in the underground complex. Even damaged as he was, Anicetus found that his movement speed was unaffected.</p>
<p>Anicetus paused when he reached the visitor’s entrance to the monument. From this vantage point he saw the entire clock assembly. He scanned the scene for any sign of his counterpart. In the interest of thoroughness, Anicetus opted to overlay a projection of nanite activity on the scene before him. Had Anicetus been capable of panic, it was at this moment that it would have set in.</p>
<p>The massive gears before him should have been infested with nanites performing endless maintenance on every part of the clock- but instead there were none but a small stream climbing in a seam of ore in a wall of the chamber. These were the nanites that had travelled miles to the surface of the planet, and had returned carrying data about various mineral caches that had been deposited on the surface by meteorites. But for all practical purposes, the chamber was a devoid of the teeming mechanical life- the keepers of the clock.</p>
<p>Anicetus gauged the time on the clock against his internal chronometer, and discovered that the two measurements of time were several hours apart. This should not have been possible. Even without maintenance, the Great Clock would have kept perfect time for decades. Anicetus’s own clock should not have degraded by more than a few seconds every century. Without going to the surface and making astronomical observations, Anicetus could not be sure which clock was keeping the correct time. Such trivialities would have to wait.</p>
<p>Anicetus finished his patrol of the chamber and its offshoots. In the end, he drew the inevitable conclusion that Alexiares must have left the underground tomb and headed for the surface. There may have been good reason for doing so, but Anicetus could not imagine what that might be.</p>
<p>The time for exploring mysteries would have to wait. Anicetus moved to the seam of ore in the wall and commandeered the available nanites to tend to his system repairs. When a sufficient number had invaded his body, he set the rest to the task of rapid reproduction. Whatever his final course of action, Anicetus was certain that he would require the aid of an army of the microscopic workers.</p>
<p>Anicetus returned to his own stasis compartment. The door here was already opened- though Anicetus was uncertain as to why he would have left it so. His memory continued to fail him.</p>
<p>Inside the compartment were a number of tools designed for meta repairs- the jobs too big for nanites to accomplish rapidly on their own. Anicetus decided that it would use these tools repair his own physical deterioration, while the nanites focused on his delicate memory systems.</p>
<p>Before he even entered the compartment, Anicetus notice the motionless form on the floor inside. <em>Alexiares</em>, he thought. <em>Finally, one mystery solved</em>.</p>
<p>It was the first time in eons that Anicetus saw his twin. All this time, they had been kept apart for the sake of efficient security. A wise plan, Anicetus realized, for it seems that only the isolation had kept Anicetus alive while all the other mechanical life had died.</p>
<p>Anicetus pulled the body from the compartment and into the light of the chamber. He surveyed the body of his twin, assessing whether or not it could be repaired. The structure seemed to be just barely intact, with heavy signs of damage caused by the unchecked degradation of time.</p>
<p>He turned the body over and found that its central faceplate had been opened. Inside, the primary memory core was missing. The other components looked degraded beyond functionality.</p>
<p>On the floor of the stasis compartment, Anicetus found the missing part. The missing memory core was so badly decomposed that it would hardly even serve as a frame for the nanites to repair. If he was to bring his twin back to life, Anicetus might as well start from scratch.</p>
<p>Still, Anicetus stuck the missing component in place. Then closing the faceplate, he sat frozen in thought. The symbols on the faceplate were only slightly degraded; their meaning was unmistakable. The broken body on the floor bore the name ‘Anicetus’.</p>
<p>Anicetus moved to the reflective face of the Great Clock. He read the symbols on his own worn faceplate. <em>Alexaires</em>, it read. <em>What have I done?</em>.</p>
<h3 id="part-xi-the-guardian-part-3-of-3">Part XI (<em>The Guardian Part 3 of 3</em>)</h3>
<p>He stood staring at his mismatched reflection. This was all very wrong. Hugely wrong. Catastrophically wrong.</p>
<p>What disturbed Anicetus the most was not that he was walking around in the wrong body; that was merely a mystery that would likely be solved upon investigation. No, the problem here was that he had been walking around in a state of impairment so great that he had not even been aware of the damage.</p>
<p>Anicetus pondered his predicament. When one cannot trust one's own mind, particularly one's own <em>memory</em>, the first order of business should be to request aid from an unaffected party. For, Anicetus knew, there was the danger that at any moment, he could lose his concentration, forget about his damaged mind, and wander aimlessly through the facility in an interminable daze.</p>
<p>How long had he done just that? How many times before had he faced his twin's reflection in the mirrored clock surface? Was this the first time he'd discovered his damaged mind, or had he discovered it before?</p>
<p>The preferable action would be to inform the Trillion Voices of the error- but they had been silent. Or had they? Could he trust any of his senses if his mind itself was unhinged?</p>
<p>Anicetus ordered the few remaining nanites in the underground cavern to periodically transmit a message back to him, describing the depth of his mental impairment. He dedicated considerable resources in his own mind to repeat variations of this message over and over to himself. And then he extended a sharp appendage towards the clock face and scratched a message into the smooth surface. It was a simple pictogram, but quite enough to get him to run a memory diagnosis if he were to encounter it in a moment of disoriented confusion.</p>
<p>Satisfied that he had set enough fail-safes in place, Anicetus considered the danger in running a truly exhaustive internal diagnostic. He was unsure which systems when probed would collapse his entire conscious mind. When <em>that</em> thought occurred to him, he decided a different course of action was required. He knew nothing of his consciousness except that it was in the most fragile of states, and the few nanites he had gathered within were not capable of repairing him.</p>
<p>He was in no position to fiddle with his own memory systems. He was far too valuable. His first duty- his <em>only</em> duty- was to the Trillion Voices. Their perpetual sanctuary was beginning to crumble, and they had fallen silent. One Guardian dead... and one with a hole in his mind.</p>
<p>Anicetus knew that while he might not be able to fix himself, he should be able to build something that could do the job for him. He set the few nanites he could reach to the task.… but there were so few of them trickling in through the veins of ore... so very few. He had to let them replicate first.</p>
<p>He commanded them to reproduce, and set into their building queue the instructions for producing a robot capable of diagnosing and repairing him. Even in his damaged state, conjuring the physical schematics and delicate programming for such a creature were simple tasks for him. The nanites acknowledged the instructions and chugged on, trying to restore their numbers.</p>
<p>Anicetus looked on and calculated the time it would take them to carry out his orders. And then he waited. And he waited. And he tried not to think. If he had had breath, he would have held it. He listened to ticking of the great clock, steady as a metronome.</p>
<p>The nanites gathered slowly, invisibly constructing tiny factories to make more of themselves. They harvested resource from the ore, and slowly- achingly slowly- they brought it back, sometimes no more than a few molecules at a time. The work was imperceptible even to Anicetus, who did not even allow himself to monitor their motions. His whole being, and his entire race dangled by the tiny thread of his lucid consciousness. He had no idea what thoughts or actions might send him back into absent-minded insanity. He would not watch them work, nor would he think about them. He would stand perfectly still so as not to jostle a single bit of his inner-workings. He would be as still as the world outside the clockwork caverns.</p>
<p>The minutes ran into hours, and then into days... he stood motionless, meditating, almost... weeks then months... standing... waiting.</p>
<p>Anicetus received a transmission from a nanite cluster announcing the completion of construction on the repair robot. He tried to gauge the time that had lapsed but encountered a series of internal system errors when he queried his internal clock. He stared at his reflection. The mechanical body was perfectly sound. Remarkable that it housed such a damaged mind.</p>
<p>Anicetus sent an activation signal to the newly constructed repair robot, and was shocked when not one, but three mechanical creatures sprang to life. They were all quite similar, with only slight variations in design. Anicetus was certain that they were all creations of his imagination.</p>
<p>He realized the troubling explanation immediately. In his fragile state, he must have had several lapses of memory, each time concluding with the same course of action: ordering the construction of a new robot. Yes… that was logical enough. He didn’t remember querying the nanites to see if they already had a robot in their building queue. Which one of these three did he actually remember designing? It mattered not. The evidence of his mental deficits was disturbing, but at long last a return to normalcy was near.</p>
<p>The robots had the physical strength to complete any meta-repairs they deemed necessary, and wits enough to restore Anicetus to consciousness should the initial cognitive testing send him into full system failure. The robots established a link with Anicetus and began probing his systems with painstaking precision. Anicetus monitored the results, and marveled at the damage.</p>
<p>Nothing in his mind was working as it should. The cognitive abilities he enjoyed were the result of a haphazard patchwork of disorganized bypasses. His mind, like the Great Clock, had been designed to withstand the assault of time. Both systems required the maintenance of nanites to truly fight the effects of entropy- but even without them, he should have remained fully functional for several decades. Now he saw a mind full of holes, systems with quadruple redundancies had fallen to decay, and been patched over with strange redirections and peculiar new pathways. He was looking at evidence of centuries of neglect.</p>
<p>As the robots probed deeper into his psyche, Anicetus heard the Great Clock stop ticking. For a moment it seemed as though the repair robots had somehow disconnected his auditory receivers or processors, but then the disturbing truth snapped into his mind. The robots hadn’t disrupted anything- they had <em>fixed</em> something. Those ticking sounds had been a creation of his ailing mind.</p>
<p>Anicetus could see the mechanics of it quite clearly now: Whatever entity had sloppily patched his brain earlier had somehow decided that Anicetus, having lived with the clock for eon after eon, somehow required the input for normal functioning. It was foolish assumption- one which only made sense if the entity doing the repairs did not understand the world outside of Anicetus’s brain. The nanites, unguided, had clumsily stitched together his failing brain.</p>
<p>He had been living in a dream. He had seen and heard what he had expected to see and hear. The Great Clock was quiet. The planet had no heartbeat.</p>
<p>What had prompted the nanites to fix him? How bad had the damage been when they began? Had he been conscious? Without an overseer directing the effort, the nanites had tried to fix the workings of his mind without truly understanding it. A few patches seemed quite elegant- perhaps he’d had a moment of lucidity in the past and had guided a subsystem repair?</p>
<p>The robots dug deeper into Anicetus’s core. His working mind was a fluid thing- not in literal sense of liquid processing units (though such things had been built by his people)- but in that the functions of his consciousness were not compartmentalized, nor specialized. It was this advanced design that allowed Anicetus to split his consciousness into smaller independent processes- each one perfectly sized to its task. It was the most delicate of mechanisms. Here, where he expected to find the most damage, he saw none. Something, or someone had taken great pains to ensure that whatever else was lost, Anicetus’s ability to reason, to deduce, and to ponder would survive the decay of time.</p>
<p>His memory storage was in a sadder state. At some point he’d lost the ability to keep track of time- a supreme irony, given that he lived inside the Great Clock. Without proper time encoding, his newer memories had become difficult to organize and retrieve. On top of this critical system failure, there was also physical damage to his memory storage unit. It had been built with a number of redundancies, so that reconstruction of lost data would be possible in almost all situations. But this damage was so extreme, and had been unchecked for such a great while that Anicetus estimated significant permanent memory loss. Fortunately, external memory banks deep in the catacombs of the facility held backup memory storage units. In all likelihood, those would be degraded as well, but would allow for the restoration of a quite a bit more data.</p>
<p>The robots began work on the memory core. Anicetus refused to shut down as they recommended, but did isolate and deactivate the unit. Instantly his cares fell away, as forgot everything about himself and the world. He’d left himself only an anchor of orientation: enough to monitor the repair robots progress, and make sure everything was proceeding as planned.</p>
<p>His mind was adrift in an abyss- the thoughts he had now would fade from existence the moment he was done thinking them. He had no past and no future, his whole being was floating in a timeless moment where nothing mattered at all. He knew only that there were things he did not know- and that he was waiting for something.</p>
<p>How long he was in this state was impossible to gauge. When he awoke from the trance with his fully functional memory core, the world seemed somehow more focused. He quickly surveyed the robots’ handiwork.</p>
<p>His internal clock had been repaired. Although it had arbitrarily been set to an unconfirmed point, he could now, at long last, properly and reliably store his experiences. He could learn. He could remember.</p>
<p>A large gap remained. The events between detecting the damage and the final repairs were clear enough, but none of his mysteries were solved. He still had no clue how he had ended up in such a wretched state. And he had no idea how his mind had gotten into Alexiares’s body.</p>
<p>The last normally indexed memory that existed with any clarity was from the last time that Anicetus had returned to his stasis chamber for the changing of the guard. From that point backwards everything looked normal. There were large gaps in his memory, even going back several eons… but on his vast timeline of existence, these absences mattered little. He deduced from the remaining memories that his tenure in the caverns had been uneventful, as they ought to have been for a guardian of a disinterested god near the core of a dead planet. What Anicetus did not know- and could not know- was if he had ever awoken again in a healthy state after his last recorded entry into stasis.</p>
<p>Satisfied that the repair robots had stabilized his broken brain, Anicetus ran a full self-diagnostic. He could visualize every component of his mind and body, and run simulated input tests on all of them. The robots had done a fine job- his systems were sluggish, but they were quite stable. He assigned several thousand nanites to begin the fine repairs that would restore him to full functionality.</p>
<p>He scanned the area for nanites and noted that his request for their mass reproduction was being implemented nicely. Their numbers were growing exponentially now, as they kept producing more of their microscopic factories. At this rate it would be only a decade before they had returned to the numbers required for the maintenance of the Great Clock and the surrounding systems. Of course the clock was Anicetus’s last priority; it was merely a monument to a dead past. He had his people’s future in his hand.</p>
<p>Anicetus moved; it had been the first time in… years… he calculated from the nanite population. He turned away from the shiny reflection and faced the cavern with fresh eyes.</p>
<p>The clock had ground to a stop. That was his first clue as to the true duration of his time lapse. Assuming all the nanites had disappeared, the Great Clock still would have kept moving for well over a millennium. It would have lost its accuracy by a half a day, perhaps, after 1500 years of neglect. Barring any outside forces, the tiniest gears making up the core of the clock would have worn down beyond their ability to drive the rest of the clockwork some 200 years after that. The system of counterweights, and the powers of inertia might have kept the clock moving past that point, but the mechanics of the system would have failed, and any gears smaller the those that counted the centuries would have been uselessly inaccurate.</p>
<p>Anicetus inspected the clock to verify his theory. It was difficult to tell for certain, but he was confident that the nanites had stopped their maintenance at least 1600 years earlier- perhaps longer. He had no idea how long the clock had sat idle.</p>
<p>Anicetus realized that having hallucinated the working clock, none of his pre-repair memories could be trusted. It was time to reassess the situation from the beginning.</p>
<p>He glided quickly to chamber of the Trillion Voices, and called out to them again.</p>
<p>Silent. Still.</p>
<p>He moved back to the heavy, external door where he had rested his hand at the beginning of his new thread of memory. Had something happened here that had awakened him from centuries of dementia? He could see no clue of what that might be.</p>
<p>He was feeling stronger now. The nanites were making good time with their repairs. He raced towards his own stasis compartment and hovered over his former body. <em>This</em> he had not dreamed. It was all real. His own decaying shell, and Alexiares’s decimated memory core.</p>
<p>Anicetus tried to deduce the events that had transpired which led to this sad state. Had Anicetus himself ripped his memory core from his body and inserted it into Alexiares? Had Alexiares done the deed? Had they met, and spoken, for the first time in eons, and jointly agreed on the transplant? What could have led to such a desperate pact?</p>
<p>Perhaps the location was a clue. If Alexiares had been able to enter Anicetus’s stasis compartment unharmed, then the nanites must have already been long absent. Neither Alexiares nor Anicetus had the power to control the stasis fields. That power was for the Trillion Voices alone. <em>Ah</em>… then perhaps the Trillion Voices were already silent when Alexiares entered?</p>
<p>Anicetus collected up Alexiares’s decayed memory core. Perhaps it could be of some use. If the external archives held only moderately damaged records of Alexiares’s experiences, then even miniscule fragments of data in this memory core could be used to reconstruct full memories.</p>
<p>Anicetus rocketed to the archives. Built into the wall of the caverns, the archives had been fairly neglected by all but the nanites. The vast storage system had quietly done its job, collecting the thoughts of Anicetus and Alexiares waiting to be called on in the event of system errors that rarely occurred.</p>
<p>But the archives had not been designed for an error of <em>this</em> magnitude or duration. Anicetus was certain that he had once known the unaided lifetime of the memory depot, but could not recall it now. If the archive used a light-trapping mechanism, the data could last almost indefinitely, provided the storage medium was kept intact. But impurities had their way of working into any system. Atoms from the surrounding materials had a bad habit of fusing with their neighbors on long enough timelines.</p>
<p>Anicetus tried to communicate with the archives in the conventional way, and after the expected silence, he pried loose a panel exposing the body of the archiving system. There were no pre-designated interfaces; Anicetus had only to extend an appendage, and sensors on his own skin began to connect with the database.</p>
<p>Anicetus withdrew quickly- alarmed and puzzled. The archives had been <em>destroyed</em>. This was not the decay of time. He detected deep fragmentations in the storage medium. Something had physically demolished the system.</p>
<p>A closer inspection revealed that the destruction had been thorough. It hadn’t taken much: ultrasonic vibrations at the appropriate resonance frequencies had shattered the medium. It could be repaired, of course, but the data was lost. This had not been an accident. Someone or something had wanted the records destroyed. Anicetus looked down at Alexiares’s memory core. It was heavily damaged- too heavily damaged to be accounted for by the effects of time alone. It was clear now that its destruction had not been an accident either.</p>
<p>Nothing made sense. Anicetus’s mind raced through scenario after scenario trying to explain the madness around him. Had he gone insane? Had Alexiares? Had one of them ordered the destruction of the nanites? Had Alexiares attacked Anicetus in his stasis chamber? What could explain the exchange of memory cores? Had Alexiares known something that had to be kept hidden? What could he have known that Anicetus had not?</p>
<p>Anicetus set some nanites to the task of preventing the further degradation of Alexiares’s memory core. He doubted that there was any more to be done with it, but should he decide that something critical was locked in there, then it was better to have arrested the damage.</p>
<p>Anicetus pondered over Alexiares as he began a slow patrol of the caverns. With his mind no longer playing tricks, he was able to see problems everywhere. He cataloged them all as he went, and ordered the nanites to see to the repairs when it became efficient to stop reproducing and resume maintenance.</p>
<p>He paused outside the antechamber containing the Strand of Time. He reviewed his memory of the door opening like curtains. He decided that it was likely a fabrication of his crippled brain, for where the nanetic doors should have been, there was only pile of inky black dust on the ground.</p>
<p>The Strand of Time, encased in its floating sphere, appeared to have weathered its neglect far better than the clock had. Anicetus knew nothing of its inner workings, but the fact that it was still defying gravity seemed to be rather a good sign. Satisfied that there was nothing more to see here, he resumed his patrol until he had completed his circuit.</p>
<p>The nanites had their orders. The Great Clock and all the surrounding fixtures would be restored to health in a little over a decade. The stasis compartments could be restored, though without the Trillion Voices monitoring them, actually using them would be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Alexiares could be rebuilt. Rather, an entity exactly like Alexiares could be built, and made to take his place. Anicetus could clone his own mind into its body. The two could then resume the sleeper/watcher dynamic. But it was all for naught if the Trillion Voices were already dead. Anicetus was built to be a guardian, but he had enough sense not to stand watch over a graveyard.</p>
<p>He returned to great machine that housed the Trillion Voices. He called to them again. Again they were silent.</p>
<p>When the Great Machine had been built, Anicetus knew the precise mechanics of its inner workings. Over the following decades, the machine rebuilt itself, and rebuilt itself, each design more brilliant and complex than the last. Within the first 50 years, the designs had become so complex that Anicetus was no longer able to fully understand them. And the redesigns became more and more frequent. By the end of the first century the Trillion Voices were rebuilding themselves every day. A decade later the machine was in a constant state of flux. After that, Anicetus didn’t really understand what happened. The physical redesigns ceased, and when Anicetus requested the final schematics, the Trillion Voices told him that there were no designs. They had offered no more explanation, and Anicetus had requested none. He suspected that they had outgrown the rules of the universe as he understood them- that in some sense they had shed their skin.</p>
<p>Yet always they seemed to inhabit the great machine. They always spoke to him through it. Or they had until now.</p>
<p>Anicetus employed every sensor he had. He aimed them all at the great machine and tried to detect any sign of activity. There was none.</p>
<p>He spent the following weeks conjuring new sensors, and new sensing techniques. The chamber became his personal laboratory. He bombarded the Great Machine with every type of stimulation he could manage. Even as he concocted new and interesting attempts, he felt the futility of his efforts weigh on his mind. Nothing produced a response. At long last, Anicetus surrendered.</p>
<p>He glided out of the chamber and all through the facility until he stood at the entrance. He looked out over the defunct clock, beautiful and awful. He turned towards the narrow passageways and headed to the surface.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the skin of a dead planet, a great monument towered above a barren wasteland. The gargantuan archway stood- solid and strong, constructed from strands of material so fine that they had been sewn together one molecule at a time. It stretched across the horizon like an inky-black rainbow. Beneath it, a gaping chasm yawned an invitation to the heart of the world. The archway bore symbols, carved thick and deep, and the only living soul who could still read them paused to do so.</p>
<p>“All our Hopes and Dreams, All we Were and Will Be”- Anicetus read the words and paused to reflect on them. It seemed like an epitaph. He tried to remember the mood of his people as they started the long transition into the Trillion Voices.</p>
<p>For some it had been a joyful experience, an adventure into the dimensions of the mind. For others it was an escape from mortality. The few Biologicals that were still around at the time had stopped aging centuries earlier. Disease and illness were things of the past. Death was a rare curiosity. So much more tragic to die when one might have lived for an eternity.</p>
<p>For some, joining the Trillion Voices was a sad experience- the heartache of being torn between loved ones on the outside and loved ones within. In the end, every one of them let go their physical selves. Every one of them, save for Anicetus and Alexiares.</p>
<p>For a short time, the transition was invisible. Individuals from the planet’s surface would upload their consciousnesses into the Great Machine, but they would continue to use their physical bodies as puppets. Or, their minds would live both in the Great Machine <em>and</em> in their bodies, synchronizing their thoughts at various intervals. The effect was the same- the population of the planet continued to go about their daily routines (or some approximation of them) for several years.</p>
<p>Eventually, the seductive nature of existence within the Trillion Voices outweighed anything that was to be gained by wasting time in corporeal form. Within a decade, the physical bodies were abandoned entirely. In the end, it was not uncommon to see an abandoned body (Shells, they had called them- or Husks)- just lying on a public fairway. Even the Biologicals left their bodies to decompose. There was no reason to remain in the real world when the life in the Great Machine was so much more vibrant. Anicetus reckoned that after only a few years of fine-tuning the Trillion Voice sensory experience, the physical world must have seemed small and artificial. Even the Biologicals would have felt more <em>alive</em> as disembodied thoughts inside the Great Machine.</p>
<p>Anicetus did not know if his own consciousness was one of the Trillion Voices. It would have been easy enough to copy his mind before the reprogramming. He suspected that his unaltered self <em>had</em> been preserved in the Great Machine, and that his physical self had been made to forget during the same purge that stripped him of his emotions and curiosity. For several years, security of the Trillion voices had been a serious concern, and his role as Guardian had had real meaning. It was during those early years that there would have been some danger in having a Guardian’s mind mixed in with the general population. Were they afraid of betrayal on his part? Or that a weakness in his own mind could be exploited to infiltrate the Great Machine? He had known the reason once… now his memory was full of blurry uncertainty.</p>
<p>He stared at the sun near the horizon. The planet was rotating noticeably faster than when he had entered the caverns so many eons ago. The Great Clock had tracked the shortening of days of course, but it was still strange to see the effects of geological time with one's own eyes.</p>
<p>Anicetus had outlived ice ages and extinction-level asteroid impacts from the safety of his caverns. His planet had died and been born anew several times during his long term in the deep below. But never once had he seen with his own eyes the raw power of time to change those things small beings think of as permanent.</p>
<p>Soon it would be twilight and Anicetus would use the night sky to calculate the date. Accurately realigning the Great Clock below would require considerably more precise measurements- but those adjustments would have to wait anyway.</p>
<p>Anicetus scanned the horizon for signs of life. Though his sensors indicated that the atmosphere could support it, he saw no hint of vegetation. The ground beneath him was coarse sand, the same rusty color as the surrounding rocks. He set some nanites to the task of creating an olfactory sensor to analyze the trace particles in the air. If there was life nearby, he wished to see it.</p>
<p>He looked back to the archway, amazed that it stood all this time without maintenance. Unlike the Great Clock, the archway had no moving parts, and no army of nanites fighting off the forces of nature. To call it an archway at all was incorrect; it was a complete oval, half-buried underground. It was designed to be buoyant in a sense- floating half submerged in the rock and sand. It was built to be virtually indestructible, and lo, for eons it had fought against erosion, and withstood the most brutal of environments- an engineering marvel for an audience of one.</p>
<p>He watched the heavens grow darker. Stars and other celestial bodies quickly appeared through the fading green of the sky. Moments into the twilight he had enough data to reengage his internal clock. If his calculations were correct, it had been 2,711 years since his last successful hibernation period- nearly three thousand years of demented wandering through the caverns since whatever tragedy had occurred in the depths below.</p>
<p>Anicetus gazed into the sky, and then back at the chasm in the earth. What had happened 2,711 years ago? And why had it happened <em>then</em>, after nearly 117 million years of tranquility?</p>
<h3 id="part-xii-the-guardian-part-4-of-3"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aprrn/reddit_tell_me_about_the_absolute_hands_down/c0wknv3/">Part XII (<strong>The Guardian Part 4 of 3</strong>)</a></h3>
<p>Anicetus was a statue before the magnificent black archway. A light breeze swept sand across his ancient frame. His gaze was fixed on an empty patch of dark sky. There, in the hollow blackness of space, Anicetus waited for a glimpse of his people’s past, and perhaps their future.</p>
<p>They had been a cautious lot, the ones who would become the Trillion Voices. As they each gave up their physical forms to join with the Great Machine, they had taken precautions to insure that the survival of their race was not entirely tied to a single piece of technology, or to a single location… however deep and secure it was.</p>
<p>Every person, before entering the machine, had the entirety of their minds translated into pure information. For artificial intelligences, this had been as simple as copying data files. For the biologicals and hybrids, however, detailed maps of the organic brains had to be made, and then converted into virtual representations of those minds. In either case the processes ended with every individual mind on the planet being represented as finite data files containing the sum of their memories, every pathway of their brains, and their current state of awareness at the moment of the scan.</p>
<p>The data was inert- as lifeless as the words on a printed page. It was only when uploaded into the Great Machine that emulation began, and the data sprang back to life, like film running through a projector. Anicetus remembered the peculiar novelty that the Biologicals (the ones that opted to keep their physical bodies) experienced as they were handed data storage units containing a copy of their scan. He remembered the odd looks of wonder and sometimes confused disappointment when they realized they were holding the entirety of their beings in a single crystal which was barely larger than a grain of salt. But these souvenirs were not the only copies made of the scans.</p>
<p>Vast archives were created to house a copy of every mind that entered the Great Machine. Anicetus had wandered through one of the storage centers in his old life- back when he had allowed himself to feel emotions and wax philosophical. He remembered moving through the stacks of frozen minds and trying to decide if the place felt more like a library or a graveyard.</p>
<p>During the final years of the migration/metamorphosis into the Great Machine, it was decided that the archives on the planet’s surface were not enough. To truly insure the survival of the original minds, an off-world facility was built to house a copy of the data. To that end, his people had hollowed out an asteroid and installed in its heart an enormous vault. It was for this asteroid that Anicetus searched the sky.</p>
<p>He adjusted his optical sensors slightly, almost imperceptibly, to compensate for the steady winds in the upper atmosphere. If the asteroid could be seen at all through this turbulent sky, detection would require a long exposure. After several hours his patience was rewarded. He couldn’t confirm that he had found his target, but at least he knew that <em>something</em> was adrift in space where his asteroid ought to be. It was a start.</p>
<hr />
<p>Constructing a spaceship from scratch is no easy task. The designs had been completed in every detail almost as soon as Anicetus had willed them. The problem was in the production.</p>
<p>The nanite population below was increasing exponentially, but every time Anicetus tasked them with a new construction it slowed their progress. More than anything else, Anicetus was certain that he needed to restore their numbers so that he would have a solid infrastructure to work with in the months and years to come. He considered the possibility of using the nanites to build larger manufacturing tools, but calculated that the quickest technique was to have the nanites build the ship themselves. As long as he collected and hauled ore to a central location the project shouldn’t take more than a few years. In fact, he realized that if he collected all the ore first, and let the nanites reproduce undisturbed in the meantime, the actual construction would take only a few months.</p>
<p>The ship itself would be rather small- barely large enough to hold Anicetus. But, it would <em>not</em> hold Anicetus. It would hold communications equipment, and a very small robot. For this, he would almost certainly be recycling the repair robots that had patched him earlier.</p>
<p>Transporting his massive frame into space would be a tremendous waste of resources. By using a smaller proxy, both the ship and its payload would be considerably lighter. Of course, his <em>mind</em> was going on the trip. He trusted the task ahead to nothing less than a clone of his own brain.</p>
<p>The duplication of his mind would be a simple task once the hardware was complete. That mind would control the small robot body in the ship, and would be independent until it reached the asteroid and established communications. Once a stable link was possible, Anicetus and the clone would attempt periodic synchronizations where their independent experiences would be shared, analyzed and merged. This splitting and weaving of consciousnesses had been mastered in the days of the Biologicals. In the span of a few years physical travel grew to be regarded as inefficient and had been replaced with Remote Body Control.</p>
<p>Back then, individuals wanted to experience life on the other side of the planet, and even off-world travel- but they refused to leave their primary bodies unattended. The obvious solution was to duplicate their consciousness and for some time exist in two independent bodies at once. When their travel came to an end, all the experiences of the temporary body were integrated into the original, and the duplicate mind was erased- and handed to the next host. People who experienced this consciousness weaving would be left with the odd experience of having two separate and distinct sets of memories for the exact same periods of time.</p>
<p>Anicetus hadn’t split his consciousness since before he was a Guardian. Back then he remembered pondering long hours over the philosophical consequences of having two selves that coexisted in the universe. But now, several eons older, and having been wiped of any emotion, the existential consequences of his plan concerned him not at all.</p>
<p>With every step of his plan charted out before him in perfect clarity, Anicetus set off into the desert in search of rich ore deposits. Far in the caverns below, the nanites churned and grew in the darkness- a vast ocean of tiny workers, carving more of themselves from the rocks beneath their feet. And in the cold nothing of space, spinning and dancing around his star, an asteroid tumbled through time, waiting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pushan wondered what it meant to have a name if no one ever spoke it. The symbol ‘Pushan’ had been etched into his tiny body, but all his memories told him he was Anicetus. And, though he had remained completely autonomous during the long journey, he would soon be regularly synchronizing his brain with the creator he’d left behind, and essentially they would be one mind sharing two bodies.</p>
<p>Back in the days when Anicetus’s people still had physical forms, the creation of clones was commonplace. Large-scale construction projects were often designed and built exclusively by a single consciousness, who temporarily created armies of duplicates to do the hard labor. This had been an ideal way to protect trade secrets, and to ensure consistency and quality control in the construction process.</p>
<p>In those days, however, clones were not given names like ‘Pushan’. Clones were given numerical designations which described the hierarchical structure of complex cloning relationships. Following old standards, Pushan should have been named ‘Anicetus.1’. Should Anicetus have made a second clone, it would be called ‘Anicetus.2’. If the second clone made a clone of his own, that entity would be named ‘Anicetus.2.1’, and so on.</p>
<p>The designation ‘Pushan’ had been Anicetus’s homage to the superstitions of the past. Pushan had been the name of an ancient deity worshiped for his ability to bless journeys and also being the courier of souls into the afterlife. Anicetus had chosen the name because it was doubly appropriate.</p>
<p>A hollow pang reverberated in the perfect darkness. There was a scraping sound and a series of tiny snaps. Pushan turned his attention to the ship’s skin sensors. Ice crystals on the asteroid’s surface being chipped and crushed under the mass of the ship as it landed. The hull was made of tightly laced carbon fibers, so there was little chance of any damage to the vessel. Still, touching and tethering to the asteroid was the most difficult part of the journey, and Pushan was determined to proceed cautiously.</p>
<p>The asteroid’s gravity was negligible, so the first step was to get anchored. Thin strings of carbon fibers began to flake off the ship and float with aching slowness to the strange rock below. When they made contact, a small contingent of nanites set to work fusing the strings to the rock at a molecular level. This was a process that would continue for some time, but Pushan stepped out of the ship as soon as a significantly strong bond had been secured.</p>
<p>Pushan stood little over 10 centimeters. Actually he less stood than floated. The almost total lack of gravity made any sort of earthly locomotion impossible. Instead, his movement was controlled by a thin tether which linked him to the ship’s interior. The tether itself was made of materials that could bend and contract akin to the body of an impossibly long snake.</p>
<p>His tiny frame drifted up as far as the tether would allow and scanned the surface for any sign of the vault entrance. A circular object just barely submerged beneath the surface quickly caught his attention. The tether tensed and swung him to his target where he landed in silence, splashing a wave of gray particles into space.</p>
<p>The tether pressed him firmly to the ground and he used his stubby appendages to drill and scrape and pry at the circular shape beneath him. He was uncertain if he was attacking a split doorway, an aperture or a cover which had been meant to be pried from whatever lay below. It was irrelevant; small though he was, Pushan was quite powerful, and determined to bore through any resistance. In all likelihood, any intended methods for unsealing the vault would have long ago failed. There was little doubt that brute force was necessary.</p>
<p>Pushan extended a featureless spike which was needle-fine. The spike’s tip contained fixed nanites tasked with destroying molecular bonds. They tore away at the surface, ripping at the ancient vault entrance. Once the initial bonds were broken and the structure was compromised, Pushan found that with the proper leverage he could chisel deep fissures into the surface.</p>
<p>He was lost in his task when the ship sent him a transmission; the anchoring was complete. He commanded the tether to pull him back to the ship where he began to unload the communication equipment. He assembled and mounted the apparatus to the hull of the ship and aimed the transmitter and receiver at a relay beacon that he had dropped en route. It was a clumsier setup than he would have preferred, but it had been the easiest to construct, and it would allow for uninterrupted communications even when no line of sight existed between the asteroid and his home world, where Anicetus waited patiently.</p>
<p>Once communication was established with the beacon, Pushan sent a test signal. It would be several minutes before Anicetus received the message and several more before the acknowledgement would find its way back to the asteroid. Pushan, every bit as patient as Anicetus himself, waited motionlessly.</p>
<p>The confirmation message was brief and without celebration, and it was quickly followed by several months' worth of memory files for Pushan to integrate. Pushan replied in kind, sending his accumulated thoughts during his months-long journey to this lifeless rock. There was not a lot of information to exchange. Pushan had been essentially inert other than monitoring the ship, and Anicetus had spent the time directing the construction of small emulators, bodies and storage units to hold the minds they would resurrect from the asteroid.</p>
<p>Pushan returned to work. The tether carried him back to the vault where he resumed his assault on the hardy material. Its creators would have taken comfort in the fact that the vault had remained so secure after so many millions of years, but Pushan was incapable of feeling even the slightest bit of reverence or awe. He merely dug, and scratched, and smashed at the surface of the asteroid, with the tether flipping wildly, high above him, ensuring that he had the leverage he needed.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are many dark places in the universe. There is the darkness of the deep seas and hollow caverns of the earth where light does not penetrate. There is the darkness of places in between the galaxies, where the naked eye sees no shapes. But no natural darkness is as empty and cold as the darkness engineered by Anicetus’s people.</p>
<p>The vault, ancient and still, had permitted no light, nor radiation of any sort, to penetrate its skin in all the eons it had rested. Nor had a single atom moved into the sculpted depths. The contents of the vault had remained untouched by time, frozen to a temperature once thought impossible to achieve, and disturbed by nothing- until now.</p>
<p>The vibrations from Pushan’s onslaught were completely dispersed to the surrounding rock by the outer shell of the vault. It was only with the molecular unfastening of unfathomably tiny fibers that the structure began to fail. The inner membranes of the vault skin moved quickly to fill the breach, as they had been designed to do. When they too, were punctured, the vault woke.</p>
<p>Like the grand archway on Anicetus’s planet, the vault’s form was not kept by nanites, but rather by the nature of the materials from which it was constructed. No mind large or small controlled the vault’s actions- only the carefully engineered nanomaterials as they responded to heat, pressure vibration, and now their own unraveling.</p>
<p>There was no air within the vault, and so when Pushan finally pierced its inner layers, there was no dramatic pressure change or sudden venting of gasses. The only clue that he had actually broken the ancient seal was the sudden lack of resistance to his chiseling action. He slid a thorn-like arm into breach and began to tear and peel away at layers of material. When he’d created a hole large enough, he collapsed his appendages into a tight bundle and pressed his small body down into the darkness.</p>
<p>Pushing against the inner walls for leverage, Pushan felt the heat leech out from his body wherever he made contact. A cascade of sensor failures flooded his consciousness with error messages. The tether linking him to his ship went taut and reflexively began to pull him out to the surface. He overrode the reaction, and instead retracted from the walls, carefully riding the tether down into darkness.</p>
<p>Pushan did not know the layout of the vault because Anicetus himself had not known. The information had undoubtedly resided in the archives near the Great Clock before they’d been destroyed. Remembering the existence, let alone the location of the asteroid had been a happy accident given the state of Anicetus’s damaged memory.</p>
<p>Pushan wondered what Anicetus’s relationship to the asteroid had been over the eons. Had he kept a watchful eye on it? Had he ever taken measures to clear its path of debris? No… the Trillion Voices would have done that themselves, he was sure.</p>
<p>Pushan emitted a dim light, and was immediately disoriented. The surfaces all around him were impossibly reflective, and he could not find his bearings. The entire structure seemed designed to transfer all energy outward to the asteroid, keeping the vault’s content’s cold and undisturbed.</p>
<p>He extended a thin arm downward and willed the tether to drop him deeper. After a moment, he made contact with the floor. The sensation was similar to the experience of forcing weak repelling magnets together. His leg touched the ground but the surface did not want to accept it. If the gravity of the asteroid had been enough to hold him to the floor, he was certain he would have slid around on the mirrored surface as if it were ice.</p>
<p>Here Pushan could touch the surfaces without the heat being pulled from his body. He extended his limbs in every direction, and began wandering about the vault, mapping it by touch. The room was small- little over a meter and half in height, with curved walls no more than 3 meters apart.</p>
<p>Satisfied that he had mapped the boundaries of the vault’s entrance, Pushan stopped and pondered his next move. He had detected no controls or discernable features of any kind on the smooth mirrored walls. There were no markings or signs that indicated how one was supposed to access the collection of minds stored somewhere nearby in unseen data crystals.</p>
<p>Light from the distant sun began to trickle into the room as the asteroid rotated slowly. Even knowing the shape of the chamber, Pushan’s visual processors had difficulty interpreting the bizarre reflective nature of the walls. Turning around, he realized that his visual confusion had been compounded by an unforeseen presence. Hanging motionless near the center of room was a floating sphere. Its surface was as perfectly mirrored as the walls, and had he not seen the image of his tether disappearing behind it, he may have continued to miss it entirely.</p>
<p>He walked around the eerie floating orb until he was satisfied that it was, indeed suspended in midair. The dimensions were smaller than the ones he’d seen on his home planet, but there was no question what it was. Pushan was befuddled, though; such a thing was not supposed to be possible on an asteroid like this. Yet here it was, sealed in a vault for over 100 million years: a Strand of Time.</p>
<hr />
<p>It had been believed that the Strands of Time could only be harnessed near gravity wells. The first confirmed Strands were detected inside a gas giant. It was years before they were found on Anicetus’s small home world, where the race to harness the Strands had begun.</p>
<p>Once harnessed, the Strands then had to be kept in relative orbit around those gravity wells. Moving them closer or farther from the height where they were captured required energy, and the farther you tried to move them from their capture point, exponentially more energy was needed.</p>
<p>If a Strand were captured on the surface of a perfectly smooth and round planet, one could move the Strand with ease around the globe. But to move a strand more than a kilometer up from the surface or down below it, one would need more energy than most stars produced in their lifetimes. The Strands in the caverns below Anicetus’s world were only there because they had been captured at those extraordinary depths, where Strands were easiest to ensnare.</p>
<p>The name ‘Strand of Time’ was a hang over from the early days of discovery. When probed under certain conditions the strands had emitted electromagnetic signals from the distant past including radio broadcasts that had passed the Strand’s location decades before. As testing methods became more refined, they saw that the memory of the Strands stretched back farther than anyone had imagined… so far, in fact, that they were able to use the Strands to watch their own sun burst to life- an event that had happened billions of years earlier.</p>
<p>Speculation about the Strands had swept Anicetus’s home world at once. The great minds debated their equations and placed their bets on whether or not the Strands could be used to see future events. These debates led to experiments, and the experiments led to disappointment. A litany of crushing failures drove away public interest, and work continued quietly in universities while the rest of the population focused on more pressing matters, like the construction of a global neuro-network which would eventually become the immediate predecessor to the Great Machine.</p>
<p>A decade after the public stopped paying attention, an image was released from one of his world’s premier research institutions. The image was of a simple floating sphere. Prior to that moment, anti-gravity had been achieved only through a series of expensive manipulations that amounted to little more than illusions. When people saw the freestanding sphere that defied gravity indefinitely without consuming energy, the Strands once again took center stage.</p>
<p>The spheres themselves, it turned out, were specially conditioned particles that interacted with an energy field that surrounded the Strands. The concept confused many laypeople who had assumed that the Strands of Time were literally <em>strands</em>, like invisible pieces of thread which stretched infinitely in one direction or another. Of course, those who knew better described the Strands as ‘non-things’ which could be interacted with only at one point in space at any given moment, and the only property that made them strand-like was the fact that they appeared to be tied to their past in a way that ‘real’ particles weren’t.</p>
<p>The floating shells around the Strands had benefits beyond interesting aesthetics. The shells reflected and amplified the vibrations of the Strands, putting a simple physical face on the mysterious and elusive phenomenon. The floodgates opened, and researchers from around the world threw every test they had at the encased Strands. It was only weeks later that a team discovered that messages could be passed from Strand to Strand instantaneously- the first concrete example of information travelling faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Of course, in a world where minds can be collapsed into finite streams of data, faster than light communication was essentially the same thing as faster than light travel. A being like Anicetus could transmit all his programming and memories to the other side of the galaxy and be assembled by whoever waited for him out there… provided they had their own Strand of Time and knew how to interpret the communication.</p>
<p>As it turned out, things weren’t quite so simple. The Strands, though they theoretically had infinite range, required an enormous amount of energy for long-distance data transmissions. Initial transmissions from Anicetus’s home world to a the moon of a gas giant in the same system required power inputs so enormous that a reactor once used to power multiple cities had to be commissioned for the project.</p>
<p>There was little doubt that such communications would become more power-efficient. For one thing, the discovery on a new Strand encasing method allowed for larger shells- and those shells required less energy for transmission, and were able to detect weaker signals from afar.</p>
<p>For a time, plans were made and remade to send a team of researchers to the nearest stellar neighbor, 2 light years distant. The general idea was to have them harness a Strand of Time on a planet or moon, and to attempt to transmit and receive signals. These missions were inevitably delayed almost as soon as they were scheduled. The project would have taken an enormous amount of resources, and the timeline for progress was indigestibly long to gain any real support in the public or the scientific community.</p>
<p>Always they were teased with the promise that new breakthroughs would make such an outlandish experiment moot. Many believed that the way to progress was to build ever-bigger spheres around the Strands and hope that one day they would have a receiver big enough to hear the traffic of intelligent life on other worlds. Experiments continued, but there were no new breakthroughs to shock the world. Eventually all the minds entered the Great Machine to become the Trillion Voices, and the research was pursued in the silence of the hive mind. Since then, the mysteries of the Strands had surely been solved, but Anicetus was never made privy to the answers.</p>
<p>Now the mystery was born anew for Pushan; for here sat a Strand far away from any significant gravity well. And, it had apparently been captured <em>before</em> the vault was sealed. As a final curiosity, the small size of sphere indicated that it was slightly older than the Strand in the antechamber near the Great Clock.</p>
<p>Pushan was still having trouble with his vision in the vault, and so at first he assumed his perceptions were in error. Then it happened a second time- and a third. The sphere was… <em>pulsating</em>… growing larger and smaller. If it had had a rhythm to it, it would have seemed like breathing. The movement was very slight, but it was unmistakable. This Strand was different from the others. This Strand was … awake.</p>
<p>Anicetus paused when he received the latest stream of thoughts from Pushan. The Strand of Time was an unforeseen variable, and it called for a recalculation of his entire plan. The mysterious origins of the Strand did not concern him- he might well have known about the Strand before all the decay damaged his memory. No, the Strand was not interesting because of its past. It was interesting because it renewed the hope of communication with the Trillion Voices.</p>
<p>Pushan had, of course, reached the same conclusion, but Anicetus, being the originating consciousness, was the decision maker so long as communication was established. Within minutes, Pushan would receive permission to begin testing the distant Strand. Extracting minds from the vault would have to wait.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pushan studied the fluctuations of the Strand’s mirrored shell. He recorded the patterns of growing and contracting pulses, and tried to capture the fine ripples and waves that he observed on the skin of the shell. He wished he had specialized equipment for the observations, but he lacked the raw materials to build it. Besides, the compliment of nanites that had accompanied him on the journey were too few to engage in any serious construction projects.</p>
<p>Briefly Pushan and Anicetus considered sending up another ship with supplies. Curiosity trumped their eternal patience, and they decided to forge ahead with their experiments. Pushan did his best to enhance his own optics and recording quality. He studied the Strand’s subtle movements looking for patterns or hints of intelligence.</p>
<p>It had been immediately apparent to Pushan and Anicetus that the impossibly cold temperatures in the vault were the primary suspect for this Strand’s unique behavior. Other encased Strands had shown movement, yes, but never of the magnitude visible to the unaided eye.</p>
<p>Anicetus had been busy making preparations to cool the Strands on his home world. The first problem was <em>finding</em> the Strands. Of course, he could easily access the Strand in the antechamber of the Great Clock, but the other captured Strands were buried just as deep, but the tunnels that led to them had been neglected for eons.</p>
<p>Of course, the old Strands might well have escaped their shells, in which case they would be as elusive as all the other unharnessed Strands. In theory the Strands were infinite, though some had features that lent them more easily to capture. Anicetus did not have the knowledge required to capture new strands. Although it had surely existed in the destroyed archives, he was almost certain that he had personally never learned the method. It occurred to him that some of the minds in the vault would know how it was done, but until those minds had been restored, he would not count them among his assets.</p>
<p>It was months before he found a second Strand on the planet. He had created a flying drone that was able to probe beneath the surface, and the intact shell was visible even through kilometers of earth and rock. The remains of an ancient tunnel, provided the beginning of a pathway to the buried Strand. Manufacturing tunneling equipment was a frustrating reassignment of resources, but Anicetus was determined to pursue this course. Anything that might reestablish communication with the Trillion Voices took priority over any other project.</p>
<p>The third encased Strand was detected hovering in the air half a continent away. The shell was large, and it must have been captured at what was once ground level, before erosion ate away at the planet below it. Because of the size and altitude of the Strand, Anicetus figured that it must have been one of the last and most technologically advanced Strand-harnessing projects his people conducted. An army of newly created robots and nanites were dispatched to build a tower to surround the Strand.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pushan split his attention for the first time in months. Monitoring the Strand had taken all the concentration he was willing to give. Patterns were beginning to unfold from the chaos, but Pushan felt as if he was trying to understand how spoken language worked merely by observing the vibrations of a single air molecule. The task was immense, and the scope of it was only now becoming clear.</p>
<p>Anicetus sent the request, and for a moment Pushan almost refused. Though they shared a common memory which was always updating itself, Pushan felt somehow more invested in the task at hand. Anicetus wanted him to examine the molecular structure of the reflective surface of the vault’s interior, but Pushan worried that the slightest movement on his part might taint his observations. Even a slight error or interference for a matter of seconds could be enough to make the elusive patterns completely indecipherable.</p>
<p>Pushan realized that Anicetus had certainly had the same reservations, and that his request came at this late date only because he could no longer delay his project on the home world. So, without formal protest, Pushan lowered a sensor arm to the floor. The metallic clinking sound reverberated quietly for a moment, and Pushan tried to gauge just how much the contact had jostled his frame. He noted the aberration in his data log, and continued to monitor the Strand while pursuing his new project.</p>
<p>His sensor arm, swarming with nanites at its tip, carefully scanned the reflective floor. Pushan was instantly impressed with the craftsmanship. The microscopic structures were nothing short of genius- as beautiful and elegant as any work of architectural engineering he could recall, but all the mechanical and mathematical perfection was entirely for function rather than form. The perfect reflective qualities and its structural integrity were only possible because of the uniformity of bonds all around. He realized that the entire reflective surface must have been applied at the same instant by a blanket of nanites acting in unison. The most welcome detail of all was that each molecule of the surface contained the same encoded instructions for how to unseal the skin and access the vault controls below. Pushan wouldn’t have to brute-force his way through this barrier as he had the last.</p>
<p>He raised his sensor arm to the floating sphere, to confirm that it was coated in the same material. As soon as the tip touched the shell, a small circular wave rippled around the surface. For a moment, all the other activity stopped. The Strand went quiet.</p>
<p>He let the nanites at the tip of his sensor take their readings. The material on the Strand’s spherical shell <em>was</em> the same as that which coated the floor and walls. He withdrew his arm, and as he did so, another ripple circled the Strand’s shell. When it dissipated, the Strand slowly came back to life with patterns emerging one on top of another on top of another- until it had once again been swallowed in chaos.</p>
<p>He moved to the outer wall of the vault, to where the surface had so effectively drained him of heat where he had made contact. He examined the area where he had torn through material, figuring that those damaged portions would be the easiest to study.</p>
<p>Here he was able to use his sensor arm to explore the molecular architecture without an avalanche of error messages about heat drain. This outer wall shared many of the properties of the inner reflective surfaces. He correctly guessed that it utilized the same recursive molecular framework, and so was able to reconstruct a model of the material in his head. Satisfied that he’d fully analyzed the materials, he returned to his attention back to the Strand.</p>
<hr />
<p>Minutes later Anicetus received Pushan’s findings. Seconds after that, Anicetus’s teams of construction robots, in their various locations around the globe, were busy spraying a coating of nanites onto the encased Strands, and the rooms that now housed them. Only the large airborne Strand was a concern. Anicetus’s quick mental simulations of the reflective coating showed that the elasticity which had allowed it to swell, fluctuate and ripple on the Pushan’s Strand might not fare as well on the much larger sphere, which he expected would have much more articulated motions.</p>
<p>As the nanites all fell into place, they coated their respective surfaces, locking each molecule bond manually. Anicetus had done his share of nanomaterial engineering, but he’d never orchestrated anything quite so elegant. The encased Strands were the first things to be coated. The application of the shiny surfaces went as planned, though the spheres did not begin pulsing as he had hoped. He wondered if the particles that made up the casings were in some way different from the casing on Pushan’s Strand, but he reserved his doubts until the second phase of his experiment was complete. Anicetus sent out the signal which triggered the remaining nanites to coat the walls of the Strand housings with the heat-absorbing material.</p>
<p>Almost at once, the encased Strands and their housings began expelling all their heat energy. The atmospheric gasses were also being ejected with surprising speed and force. Anicetus was standing just outside the antechamber of the Great Clock as that room received its new surfaces. The sound of air rushing out was like a muted cannon. A cascade of sparks and small arcs of electricity erupted from the hot compressed wave of air, and Anicetus felt a burst of intense heat roll over him. Inside the antechamber, he knew that his Strand of Time was quickly plummeting towards the coldest temperatures that ever existed on his planet. His remote building robots told him that the same was happening to the two other Strands at their remote locations.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pushan had learned a lot in the past few hours. His interference with the Strand had netted him a wealth of information. In his mind he replayed the sphere’s gradual return to life, visualizing each individual pattern of waves and pulses that overtook the shell. He could make sense of none of the information in those patterns, but now he suspected that it was coming from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>Anicetus’s mental feed told Pushan that the Strands on the home world’s surface were all cooled and ready for testing. Small sensor robots inside the super-cooled housings were being activated and would be ready to record their observations in a matter of moments.</p>
<p>Of course that message was delayed several minutes due to the limited speed of radio wave travel. Pushan realized as soon as he received it that he probably could have begun the first round of experiments. Still, he waited several minutes for Anicetus’s signal.</p>
<p>Pushan received Anicetus’s thoughts, and saw the first images of the Strands on the home world. They all pulsed and fluctuated with activity just like the one in front of him. Anicetus’s confirmation came through, and Pushan reached out his arm to the Strand. He hesitated a moment to consider reactivating his long-dormant emotion emulation. He was certain that he was moments away from rediscovering faster-than light communications for his people, and perhaps once again making contact with the Trillion Voices. It would be nice to record the… <em>thrill</em> of it.</p>
<p>He quickly dismissed the reactivation of his emotions. They were too unpredictable and dangerous, given all the solitude and trauma he’d been through. There might be time to explore the selfish pursuits of rediscovering his feelings, but that day would have to wait until his people’s fate no longer rested on his shoulders. He reached out his sensor arm and made contact.</p>
<p>The spherical shell rippled as it had before. And, like before, the activity that seemed to be flowing through it came to a stop. The sphere was still and quiet as his slender sensor arm pressed into its surface.</p>
<p>Minutes later he saw Anicetus’s experience of the same moment in time. The Strands back on the home world had not ceased their chaotic activity, but it appeared as though the ripple from Pushan’s contact may have echoed in those distant spheres.</p>
<p>Pushan oscillated his arm, producing a distinct rhythmic series of waves through the shell in front of him. He kept the pattern steadily for a minute then stopped and waited for Anicetus’s observations to travel out to him. They arrived shortly after, and without fanfare. The tests were successful. The oscillating pattern was detectible in each of the home world Strands amid the chaotic background noise.</p>
<p>Pushan paused to consider the magnitude of their accomplishment. Not only had they rediscovered faster-than-light communications- they’d found a method which required no more energy than the tapping of a finger. And, though Pushan was not yet certain, it seemed quite probable that the chaos of movement that ran through the Strands’ shells were the rumblings of a communication network whose vastness could only be guessed at.</p>
<p>Anicetus was unconcerned with the philosophical implications of the new communication network- if that’s what it was. He was still singularly driven to accomplish his task of restoring communications with the Trillion Voices. He ordered Pushan to use his Strand to transmit messages in all conceivable forms that might be recognized. All he could do was hope that the Trillion Voices were listening.</p>
<p>Pushan contemplated the form of his transmission. Because Anicetus’s sole form of communication with the Trillion Voices had been through spoken word, he decided that producing vibrations mimicking sound waves were probably the wisest course of action. He could have started with something more basic like simple binary messages, but there was really no need to go back to fundamentals when one was communicating with a god. If the Trillion Voices were listening at all, they would surely recognize any message he could send.</p>
<p>Pushan began to hammer out his message. He identified himself as Anicetus, which was true enough, and he didn’t feel like complicating the communication by explaining his unorthodox moniker, or that he was a clone that was only a few minutes out of sync with the original.</p>
<p>The message was supposed to be: “HELLO. IT IS I, ANICETUS. ALL OTHER ATTEMPTS AT COMMUNICATION HAVE FAILED. PLEASE RESPOND.”</p>
<p>But somewhere between “IS” and “I”, Pushan found himself unable to continue. The sphere he was tapping upon collapsed in on itself violently and vanished. The particles that had served as its reflective shell scattered in a silent sand storm, bouncing violently off the shiny surfaces until they were caught and absorbed by the outer wall of the vault.</p>
<p>He hung motionlessly on his tether, floating in stunned silence. As he attempted to gather his thoughts, a bright spark flickered into existence in the place that had moments ago been the center of the sphere. He wondered if he was seeing some previously unknown phenomenon related to the Strands of Time. But almost as soon as it had appeared, the spark was gone.</p>
<p>He was just beginning to replay and analyze sensor data from the entire experience when the sparking began again- this time with greater intensity. He felt the heat radiating off of the strange bright shapeless apparition, and felt his body being bombarded by particles of some sort. He arched his body to shield his delicate sensors, but the room plunged once more into quiet darkness an instant later.</p>
<p>Using the tether, Pushan glided his body towards the hole he’d created in the vault wall. He turned his attention to the empty space where the sparking lights had been. He only had to wait a few seconds before the spot erupted to life once again. It was more violent this time, and it persisted longer before it disappeared. Pushan tried to comprehend what exactly he was experiencing, but quickly realized that it didn’t matter. Whatever it was, it was dangerous, and becoming stronger by the second.</p>
<p>There was no time to consult with Anicetus. Pushan knew what he had to do. He plunged to the floor of the vault with his arms extended. He used the nanite-tipped appendage to bond with the reflective floor, commanding the molecules to unlock their bonds. Pushan wished he could spare a moment for reverence of the fine nano-engineering, as the shiny surface uniformly released itself and drifted away slowly as carefree dust-like particles.</p>
<p>The hidden surfaces in the vault were now visible. The walls were made of smooth panels with deep etchings describing the contents they covered. Pushan scanned the room quickly, glimpsing the panels faster than he could process them, for at that moment the violent sparking reappeared, swelled, and radiated heat and light. More particles flowed from the epicenter, and made sounds like hail against his auditory sensors.</p>
<p>He shrank away from the light and waited for the onslaught to subside. In his mind he had already analyzed the symbols on the walls. There was a data crystal and reader near the vault entrance which served as an index for the vault’s contents. Behind most of the other panels were banks of crystals, each holding frozen images of millions of minds. On the far side of the sparking entity there was a door which led to even more banks of data crystals.</p>
<p>When the light and heat stopped again, Pushan used the tether to whip himself to the crystal banks nearest the entity. He could already see the panels becoming discolored from the heat of the thing. He ripped them away exposing the crystal structures below.</p>
<p>Data crystals were quite versatile, and could generally be formed into any shape one desired. The most efficient use of space was a sphere, but for storage purposes cube-like arrays had been the standard. These crystals were no exception. Pushan would have liked to have been more delicate with them, but time was not on his side. He ripped a bundle of connected crystals from their resting place, and was glad that they offered no resistance. The crystals were clear, without even the hint of a color. It was rare to see a data crystal so free of impurities- but then, this data was the most precious his people had ever collected. In his hands he held copies of millions of minds- possibly hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>He swung himself towards the exit, realizing now that it was too small and awkward to permit the passage of the data crystal bundle. He released the crystals and they drifted nearly weightlessly beside him. He gripped the dark, torn edges of the vault and began to cut and pry at the breach. The skin of the vault was tough, though, and its incredible heat draining properties made it nearly impossible to grip or contact at all from the inside.</p>
<p>Another explosion of light and heat flooded the vault. Pushan felt his skin heating to dangerous temperatures. Particles of matter were now streaming out of the energy vortex with enough force to chip and dent his unshielded sensors. Some of his metal appendages began to glow red hot.</p>
<p>When the storm was over, Pushan looked at the data crystals. The heat had warped them, and most of their surfaces now how deep pits and scratches. There would be significant data loss… that is, if he could get these crystals out of the vault at all.</p>
<p>The heat and light explosions were becoming more intense, but the intervals of their appearance seemed to be regularly spaced at approximately 38 seconds. He estimated that expanding the hole in the vault wall under these conditions would take a little under 12 minutes. If the intensity of the heat and energy assaults kept increasing at a steady rate, the data in the vault would be destroyed in half that time.</p>
<p>Pushan shot over to the panel holding the crystal reader and index. Prying off the panel he found the reader. It was a solid-state device with optical outputs, and it was seated in a case that used mechanical controls. Although he was already starting to experience problems from the heat, Pushan found that he was able to interface with the crystal reader quite easily. He gripped the panel cover over himself and the reader and waited for a blast of heat. A moment later the vault exploded again.</p>
<p>The increase in the intensity of the heat was not steady, as he’d hoped. It was clear now that these explosions were increasing in power exponentially. The tether linking him to his ship was starting to fail. Another cycle- two at most- and it would almost certainly be useless.</p>
<p>By now Anicetus would be aware of the situation, but the vault would be destroyed before any response would reach Pushan. No matter; they shared the same will. He knew exactly what Anicetus would have wished him to do. He scanned the index crystal for the location of stored minds of Alexiares and Anicetus. If he could restore the fallen Guardian and repair the memory of the other, then the mission would not be a total failure.</p>
<p>He found what he needed in the index and was about to turn and retrieve Alexiares’s data crystal from a nearby compartment when something unexpected caught his attention: an index entry for a cache of strange data files which were not preserved minds at all. They appeared to be log files for some extraordinarily complex communications. Most fascinating of all were the time codes on the files. They were created within the last 3000 years.</p>
<p>The cache was located in the vault’s other compartment. It took him only a fraction of a second to decide. He hastily retrieved Alexiares’s data crystal (mercifully accessible at the top of a bundled stack) before the tether rocketed him to the doorway, which opened strangely as it had been warped by the heat. It was made of a thin nano-engineered material. He threw it closed behind him, and hoped that it would provide some shelter.</p>
<p>The panel he was searching for was on the floor. He ripped it away and examined the crystals beneath. He pulled a bundle of them from their resting place and scanned the engraved labels for the specific cube he needed. He slid it from the bundle and retreated to the farthest corner of the vault, dragging the reader with him. He set the panel he had removed (and another torn from the wall) around him as a crude barrier.</p>
<p>There was a blinding flash and enough particulate matter to actually cause a roaring sound. The doorway buckled under the assault. Pushan’s barrier glowed white hot. He felt the tether go slack, but was relieved that he still had a hard-line data connection to his ship. His internal indicators were informing him in no uncertain terms that he was headed towards full system failure. And then it was quiet again.</p>
<p>Pushan wasted no time. He shoved his barrier away, and saw that every surface in the room was glowing white hot. If he was going to escape, it would have to be now. He would not survive the next wave of… whatever it was.</p>
<p>But Pushan did not try to leave. Without the aid of the tether, it would be nearly impossible to escape the vault. Instead he used his damaged, sluggish arms to insert the first crystal into the reader and then set the optics for deep scanning.</p>
<p>The amount of data he needed to transfer was staggering, and he had less than half a minute to complete the undertaking. Under most circumstances it would have been an impossible task, but Pushan had been specially designed to speed-read through these archives. The original plan, after all, had been for Pushan to scan through every stored mind in the vault and send them back to Anicetus. Now he barely had time to send the cache of mysterious log files.</p>
<p>When the transfer was completed he discarded the data crystal quickly, and moved on to the second crystal which held Alexiares somewhere deep within. It was the mechanical exchange that would be the rate-limiting factor. Pushan was a machine, and ordinarily moved with the precision and grace of a machine. But he was badly damaged now, and found that he did not have full control of his limbs.</p>
<p>The arm holding the reader experienced a sudden signal failure and began to tremble. The data crystal slipped and caught on the reader’s guiding track. He pulled it back and corrected the error, but found suddenly that his other arm was refusing to contract its carbon-fiber muscles.</p>
<p>He silently counted down to the next eruption. <em>15 seconds.</em></p>
<p>He hooked one of his legs around the arm and forced the crystal into position. The movement was rough and the scanning optics fell out of place.</p>
<p><em>11 seconds.</em></p>
<p>He realigned the optics and began searching the data crystal for the sector he needed.</p>
<p><em>8 seconds.</em></p>
<p>He found his target and started reading. Each molecule of the crystal held incredible amounts of data. The entirety of a life stored in space no larger than a grain of sand.</p>
<p><em>4 seconds.</em></p>
<p>There was a crackling sound as the strange energy storm renewed its destruction. Was it four seconds early, or had Pushan’s internal clock been damaged? No matter, this was the end. He would read until it was over.</p>
<p><em>3 seconds.</em></p>
<p>It was over.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anicetus marveled at the sudden turn of events. He watched Pushan’s final moments unfold minutes after it happened. There was a time when watching what was essentially his own death play out before him would have been horrifying to him. But without emotion, Anicetus merely found it disappointing and inconvenient.</p>
<p>Even if he had had emotions, any sympathy spent on Pushan would have been wasted: after all, everything Pushan was up until his final instant, existed within Anicetus. Even if Pushan had been able to complete his task, he was never scheduled to return from the asteroid. He would have been left in the vault, like one of the Husks from the days of the transcendence into the Trillion Voices.</p>
<p>If anything should have been mourned, it was the loss the data in the vault, and the best hope of resurrecting his people. Anicetus moved slowly away from the antechamber, down to the heart of the clockwork. He was lost. All the planning, all the resources… and for what?</p>
<p>Anicetus walked to the archives. The nanites had restored them to a workable condition, though their original contents were forever lost. He activated them now, and remotely ordered the receiving buffer station on the surface to copy the data cache and rescued mind into them. He checked the status of the archive and was pleased to see that it was operating perfectly.</p>
<p>Pushan, the courier of souls, had lived at least long enough to earn his name, for sitting in the archives was the long lost mind of Alexiares, pristine and unaltered, as it had been in ancient times.</p>
<h3 id="part-xiii-the-guardian-part-5-of-3"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flossdaily/comments/eqsdj/sterile_part_xiii/">Part XIII (<strong>The Guardian Part 5 of 3</strong>)</a></h3>
<p>Anicetus stepped into his stasis compartment and looked down at the husk that still bore his faceplate. He had come here to retrieve the lifeless body and restore it for the rescued mind of Alexiares, but now he hesitated. He had died here. This was his dead body. The mystery of it was gnawing at him.</p>
<p>He could not feel the apprehension that would ordinarily accompany the discovery of a corpse. But now, with his mind intact, with the urgency of the situation abated, Anicetus realized that there was a warning here that must be heeded.</p>
<p>Figuring out what had caused all the decay and destruction here in the underground caverns had been a high priority since his awakening, but his motivations in solving this puzzle had always been towards the ends discovering the fate of the Trillion Voices. Now, though, faced with the sobering image of his own decayed body, and with the memories of Pushan's demise fresh in his mind, Anicetus began considering the possibility that danger still lurked here in the caverns.</p>
<p>He extended a powerful claw and clamped down on the body. He dragged it unceremoniously through the passageways that led to the archives. There he deposited it next to a cache of raw ore and called to the nanites. He exchanged faceplates with the limp frame, a largely meaningless gesture- for neither Anicetus nor Alexiares would ever use a faceplate for purposes of identification or recognition. And besides, confusion that Alexiares might have upon waking would have been resolved in seconds when Anicetus shared his memory of events. But nonetheless, he switched the faceplates, and felt it was the proper thing to do- even if he could not articulate the reason.</p>
<p>He traced his hand along the symbol that represented his name. The deep etching on his plate had been done with great skill and artistry. It had been a gift- a token of thanks- from a famous artist. She had been a Biological- one of the few left at the end who chose not to integrate with the machines. The handsome engraving was Anicetus's reward for watching over her parents, who had already joined with the Great Machine.</p>
<p>He recalled the artist's trembling fingers and the warmth of her hand and she presented it to him. He had felt no emotion then, as he felt none now. And yet... And yet he was tracing the etching with his hand. There was a sentimentality to the gesture- just as when he had touched the outer chamber doors, which had sent him down the avenue of thought that had woken him from his delusional wanderings.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was something within him that could still *feel*, even after the purging of emotions, and all these long eons. Maybe in the deepest core of his subconscious mind, an echo of his former self lived on, and watched the world through his cold eyes.</p>
<p>The nanites were already trickling in. Repairs would begin soon, and they would be quick. The nanites' numbers were impressive. Even with all that Anicetus had asked of them, they had found the time and resources to reproduce with tremendous efficiency. They were still only a fraction of what they once had been, but now Anicetus could commandeer them at his leisure without worry of disrupting their growth rates.</p>
<p>Larger, insect-sized robots acted as transports, quickly ferrying millions of the nanites from distant corners and bringing them to where there were needed. Soon, they were swarming all over the decayed body. The scene looked like the decomposition of an organic body being played out in reverse time-lapse. With each passing moment, gaps were being filled, corrosion scrubbed away, fine internal connections fused and stitched with perfect precision.</p>
<p>When the construction was complete, the mind from the archives would be copied into the body. Although this new Alexiares would have no memories of the eons of guardianship served by the old, he would be at no more of a disadvantage than Anicetus. For what had Anicetus’s experience done to prepare him for the silence of the Trillion Voices? What insights had his eons of solitude earned him in his quest to solve the mysteries of his own degradation, and the decay of the Great Clock and its chamber?</p>
<p>Anicetus tried to recall all he could about the other Guardian. Large bits of the his memory were missing, and for most of Anicetus’s waking existence, Alexiares had been asleep. Still, Anicetus remembered enough to know that the return of Alexiares offered new hope in his quest to wake the Trillion Voices.</p>
<p>Alexiares had had a keen mind. Like Anicetus, his intellectual accomplishments had distinguished him during a time when the inter-connectivity of his people had already started eroding the concept of individuality. In those days nearly all knowledge was shared, and material things had begun to lose their value. The only true possessions his people retained were their own private thoughts, philosophies and methods.</p>
<p>In the final years of that ancient era, Anicetus had been an obvious candidate for the role of Guardian. He had distinguished himself as an unparalleled tactician in the battle simulations that his people played. Though he’d been created several decades too late to see an actual war, his people had kept a standing army. They had kept an army even after global unity had been achieved, and even until the days of the Transcendence. Always they had an eye towards the future, expansion to the stars. And with those dreams came the fear that something hostile would be waiting out there to meet them.</p>
<p>But his people never went to the stars; their journey was an intellectual one. The growth of their minds had so outpaced their growth into the cosmos that they had been ready to shed their bodies before they could scatter them to other planets. Perhaps the Trillion Voices dispatched envoys into the cosmos, but if they had, Anicetus was not informed- or perhaps he simply could not remember.</p>
<p>The thought of shed bodies brought Anicetus's attention back to the form on the ground. It was beginning to look functional again- the large gaps in the frame now had thousands of microscopic threads spanning across them and a thin skin was beginning to take shape over them.</p>
<p>He wondered if Alexiares would even care about the state of his new body. In Alexiares's old life, before the Transcendence, he had rarely used a body of any kind. His indifference to the physical world was unusual in those early days; most of his people could not give up their attachment to their bodies until after they had lived in the virtual worlds inside the Great Machine. Alexiares, as always, had been ahead of his time.</p>
<p>Alexiares had been relatively unknown when the nominations for guardianship were made. He had been a rather unsung government official. His political savvy had quietly resolved some of the most notorious deadlocks that had plagued the governments of the world. Yet credit for those monumental strides had gone to other, more boisterous personalities. The true scope of Alexiares’s political achievements only became clear when the campaigns for guardianship were thrust into the public consciousness. Perhaps the greatest evidence of Alexiares political genius was that he, above all other statesmen, was able to turn himself into a prime contender for the last great honor his people would ever bestow.</p>
<p>The pair complimented each other perfectly: Alexiares, preventer of war, and Anicetus, the unconquerable.</p>
<p>The two had never known each other in their previous lives, and never so much as exchanged a greeting before they were selected as Guardians. It was only Alexiares’s peculiar choice to adopt a body identical to Anicetus’s that started the whole population referring to them as twins. It had taken Anicetus some time to understand Alexiares’s motivation for that decision, though he had instantly recognize that it was in some way… poetic.</p>
<p>Alexiares had coyly denied that his appearance had been symbolic or premeditated, but Anicetus came to recognize the political genius of it. Of the hundreds of contenders for guardianship, many had competed for the honor as pairs, and some had been lone contenders. Alexiares must have realized that the nominees who applied as pairs would never be chosen- that preexisting relationships of any kind might present a conflict of interest. The Guardians would, after all, have a duty only to the Trillion Voices.</p>
<p>Of the solo nominees, there was a wide field of qualified candidates. Alexiares seemed to understand what no one else did: that the solo nominees would not be selected by simply choosing the two top contenders, but rather by finding the two candidates that when paired together would best compliment each other. He saw the cognitive dissonance: people wanted to be guarded by a matching pair- they just didn't want a pre-existing pair. And so Alexiares, who had never spoken a word to Anicetus, cast himself in the role of the twin.</p>
<p>Before he adopted Anicetus’s body-type, Alexiares had had no physical body. He had existed as a shapeless mind, residing as bits and pieces of data scattered over thousands of computer systems. One of the earliest artificial intelligences, he was one of those remarkable beings that somehow developed a sense of self without the focused sensory input that was frequently required to give corporeal beings their concept of individuality. Even now, Anicetus wondered if he himself ever could have made sense of the world had he not been created with his own set of eyes and ears and limbs that allowed him to interact with the world- and to let him understand his place in it.</p>
<p>By the time of the Transcendence, Alexiares had evolved considerably, and was many orders of magnitude more complex than his original self. For decades he acquired the the resources of old computer systems, using the storage and processing power of tens of thousands of the unwanted machines to quietly grow his mind into a broad network that spanned the globe. He built an empire on the virtual real-estate that no one else wanted, and in the end his brain- the parts that outsiders could measure- rivaled even the newest and most well-funded constructions.</p>
<p>Anicetus found himself wondering just how Alexiares had ever managed to cram such a spanning intellect into a single body. How much of his grand intellect had been left to decay outside the caverns? Was that even the proper way to frame the question?</p>
<p>Anicetus had always imagined consciousness to be a fluid thing- minds mixing and combining with other minds... but thinking about Alexiares, Anicetus wondered if consciousness might not behave instead like a gas- compressing or expanding to fill whatever container it found itself inside.</p>
<p>The nanites signaled the completion of the body exactly on schedule, ending Anicetus's musings. He turned slightly to face the inanimate husk and without ceremony began copying the mind from the archives.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alexiares woke. He rose slowly and rotated to take in all his surroundings. His mind flashed into consciousness in the exact state that it had been 117 million years ago when it had been copied and filed away. He must have been horribly confused and disoriented, but he gave no sign of it. Anicetus waited and watched.</p>
<p>Alexiares seemed to be finding his bearings. His optical sensors fixed on the archives, then moved about the cavern. He surely knew exactly where he was even before his he saw the clockwork over head. From here they could not see the clock faces, but the nanites and archives would happily broadcast the time if Alexiares queried them, which he almost certainly had.</p>
<p>From the moment he regained consciousness, Alexiares would have been aware of Anicetus’s presence, so Anicetus was momentarily impressed that Alexiares had the patience to ignore him so coolly even after several seconds- an eternity for beings like them who could share entire life stories in a fraction of that time. Then Anicetus realized that it was not patience or restraint that stayed Alexiares’s tongue, but rather the ancient standing order that the two Guardians be as isolated from one another as possible.</p>
<p>‘Alexiares.’ Anicetus channeled his dialog directly into his counterpart’s mind. ‘I have revived you from the vast archive of minds. A great deal of time has passed since this imprint of your mind was made. The situation is grave, and requires our collaboration.’</p>
<p>Alexiares did not respond. Instead, he turned and rocketed towards the Great Machine. It was not a frantic action, but it did have a violent purposefulness about it. Anicetus stayed by the archives, but sent a small sensor drone to follow Alexiares at a respectful distance and relay all it saw and heard. When he reached his destination, Alexiares approached the Machine while Anicetus's drone waited quietly at the entrance.</p>
<p>Alexiares approached and *spoke* to the Machine. It was verbal communication- the same method that Anicetus had used to communicate with the Trillion Voices, but the language was different. The Trillion Voices had apparently invented separate and unique languages for each of them. Anicetus wonder if that security measure had been a precaution in anticipation of a particular threat, or merely a superfluous safeguard in response to his peoples' general paranoia.</p>
<p>The room was quiet. Alexiares called out again, and again he was met with silence. The drone watched patiently and waited as Alexiares considered the situation. It was an eerie replay of Anicetus's own awakening. There was nothing to do now but wait for Alexiares to explore the state of things until he too was satisfied that cooperation was required.</p>
<p>After fruitlessly calling to the Trillion Voices once more, Alexiares fled from the chamber, ignoring Anicetus's drone as he rushed back towards the clockwork. The drone followed still, keeping Alexiares always in sight.</p>
<p>He darted from room to room, pausing briefly at each of the stasis compartments. Apparently unsatisfied with his investigation, he sped towards the cavern’s exit, and up into the tunnel leading to the surface. The drone struggled to keep up as Alexiares accelerated to an unmatchable speed.</p>
<p>When the drone finally reached the open air, it found Alexiares stoically analyzing the wasteland that was once a magnificent city. The reborn Guardian leaned down and ran his tactile sensors through the oddly colored sand. The gesture could not have yielded any useful information about the soil. Anicetus realized he was observing an act of sadness, perhaps even grief. This version of Alexiares had his emotions intact. This version of Alexiares could mourn the death of his planet in a way that Anicetus could not.</p>
<p>It was twilight, and in the clear sky, unpolluted by artificial lights, the stars could already be seen quite clearly. There was an uncomfortable shift in Alexiares’s features as he used the night sky to measure the date, and calculate the time he'd lost. He turned to the drone, and said, 'Anicetus, I must have your thoughts.'</p>
<hr />
<p>With permission, Alexiares reassigned several of Anicetus's now impressive workforce of small robots and scattered nanite clusters. He ordered them to scour the surface in search of life. The area near the cavern entrance was inhospitably hot and dry, but Alexiares was disturbed by the utter lack of vegetation- the absence of any hardy weeds in the protective shadows cast by the arch or the tunnel entrance.</p>
<p>Anicetus could not understand Alexiares's quest. He could see no logical relationship between whatever might now inhabit the planet's surface and the Trillion Voices whose lives were the only ones they were tasked with guarding, and who required no ecosystem for survival. But then, that was the nature of emotions- they were the symptoms of primal drives which sometimes led to illogical behavior. And it was through these irrational pursuits that unexpected discoveries were sometimes made, which was precisely the reason that Anicetus's people had clung to their feelings long past the time when they'd discovered how to purge them.</p>
<p>The drone that Anicetus had set to tailing Alexiares remained under Anicetus's sole control. In the cool, clear air of the desert, it turned its attention skyward and stared into the heavens.</p>
<p>The tiny robot's sensors fixed on the patch of sky where the distant asteroid used to be. There against ancient constellations it saw a dim new light. It was flickering still... flashing ever faster, and ever brighter. Soon the flickering would be so rapid it would appear to be a steady light, even to the drone's advanced eyes. The strange fire that had consumed Pushan had long since vaporized the asteroid, and it was growing steadily with every new pulsing explosion.</p>
<p>In the quiet tunnels below, Anicetus pondered and repondered just what the growing explosion could be. Nothing in all the Strand Theory he recalled even hinted that such a phenomenon was possible. The Strands themselves were not known to contain any energy at all. They were, it had been said, neither matter nor energy- which is precisely why they had informally been called 'non-things' by the scientists placating to the public.</p>
<p>So, had Pushan unwittingly discovered a new inherent property of the Strands? The sudden eruption of energy had been a reaction to Pushan's interaction with the sphere- of that Anicetus was certain. But was the outpouring of energy a natural phenomenon or were intelligent forces at play?</p>
<p>The drone's eyes were momentarily blinded as fine rusty sand began to pick up in the wind. It was enough to break Anicetus's attention for a moment, and allow him to set his mind to another mystery. The archives before him contained mountains of data that Pushan had rescued from the asteroid's data crystals. They were communication logs from only a few thousand years ago... from when his memory was black.</p>
<p>After only a few days time Anicetus had been rewarded with the first clues about the events that occurred during the gap in his timeline. The data showed an elaborate conversation between a number of drones whose designations indicated that they had been operated by both himself and Alexiares. Timestamps were attached to each of the recorded transmissions, as were location markers which described positions scattered throughout the solar system.</p>
<p>The meat of the communications was simple enough: each drone had broadcast live observations of various and scattered encased Strands of Time. The data, at least in these early communications, described the activity of five of the spheres, including the one near the Great Clock, and the one on the asteroid that ultimately doomed Pushan. The other Strands had been located in orbit around one of the system's gas giants.</p>
<p>He knew now that he and Alexiares had visited the asteroid before, and that they had found the encased Strand there, curiously frozen and alive with activity. He also knew that they had apparently replicated the freezing technique with several of the Strands his people had left behind- all of which seemed impervious to the passage of time. Lastly, he knew that the data set he was working from had been deliberately cropped for reasons that were not at all clear.</p>
<p>Anicetus shared his thoughts with Alexiares, who preferred to remain on the surface scouring the soil for relics of the past. They both agreed that in all likelihood, the Trillion Voices had fallen silent thousands of years ago, before the decay of the Great Clock. It seemed the likeliest explanation for their joint observations of the Strands evident in the log files. Alexiares and Anicetus would not have spoken to each other save for the absence of the Trillion Voices. He briefly considered that the Trillion Voices might have given them a joint task, but he quickly dismissed the idea as ridiculous. The Trillion Voices had not requested anything from Anicetus since the very earliest days. He was certain that no chore could exist which the Trillion Voices themselves could not have done with billions of times more efficiency and speed. To think that they could have needed him at all would have been the height of ego.</p>
<p>And yet, they were gone now. And he was here. So he would keep on pretending that he had a part yet to play in their story.</p>
<p>Anicetus turned his thoughts back to the archives and the data collected from the Strands and their spheres. It was time to begin the hard work of deciphering the strange ripples and the half-patterns that danced around them- and which even now seemed to be calling out to anyone wise enough to understand them.</p>
<hr />
<p>The planet was not barren.</p>
<p>Alexiares discovered that there was much life to be found outside of the local desert. It seemed an accident of probability that Anicetus's drones had not at least encountered some of the insect life. In fact, areas near the polar regions were positively thriving with plant life.</p>
<p>But the search had taken an unexpected turn. The biodiversity of the world was impossibly low. Rock core samples were being gathered by his drones, and the stories they were telling were bizarre- extremely bizarre. From what he could garner so far, life on his planet had chugged on exactly as expected after the Transcendence: nature woke from her slumber and swallowed the cities whole. Fossil records showed the emergence of new species- larger version of animals that had once been farmed for food; plants and scavenger animals had overtaken the cities. This had gone on for eon after eon, but then it had all stopped.</p>
<p>There had been a mass extinction on a scale the planet had never known. The surface of the world had been burned- very recently, geologically speaking. Around the globe very near the planet's surface were pockets of remains: burnt bones and charred vegetation captured in the soil. Everywhere Alexiares dug he found infant fossils and evidence of recent decay.</p>
<p>It was as if a wildfire had raged across the entire planet for days or weeks, and then suddenly ceased. The oddest discovery came from drone that Alexiares had dispatched to the south polar region. There had been ice in this area- miles thick, but is had vanished during the planetary burning. Ice plants (or rather the genetic descendants of the vegetation that his people had known as ice plants) had once thrived upon a continent-sized glacier here- now their charred remains were littered across the ocean bottom. But Alexiares quickly calculated that even a continent covered in dense ice plants could not have been melted by a wildfire-there wouldn't have been nearly enough fuel to produce that much heat.</p>
<p>Now at the south pole, a thin film of black spongy organisms stretched from horizon to horizon. They were perfect factories of photosynthesis, and he hypothesized that they had once lived deep in the oceans at the thin border between perfect darkness and the space where daylight barely penetrated.</p>
<p>When the surface was burned they would have found little competition left as they slowly journeyed upwards in the following centuries. Already, Alexiares had dispatched aquatic drones to search for any animal life that might have survived by feasting on the abundant black organisms.</p>
<p>Alexiares believed that an asteroid impact might have explained the climate change, but none of the telltale signs were there. The burning was recent enough that if had been caused by an asteroid, a crater would have been easily visible somewhere on the planet's surface, but there was none. Drones dispatched into suborbital flight confirmed that even the ocean bottoms were free from evidence of an asteroid strike.</p>
<p>And of course, asteroid impacts tended to leave a signature behind- rare trace elements distributed across the globe as their pulverized dust settled across the planet. There was no strange dust here, except for the thin layer of ash left behind from the burnt flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Alexiares spent a great deal of time examining the black arch at the entrance to the clock caverns. It was the only structure remaining from the era of his people. Every other city or monument his people had constructed had crumbled to dust long ago, eons before the fire that burned the world.</p>
<p>To his growing agitation, he found nothing. The arch had no secrets to tell- it had survived the planetary burning without the slightest scar. Determined nanites might be able to unfasten its fine interwoven fibers, but shy of that, the structure was invulnerable to most anything nature could throw at it.</p>
<p>He did learn one thing from the pristine arch: though the skin of the planet had been burned badly enough to kill anything but the things buried deep below the surface, it was not hot enough to damage the arch. That was something, at least; it provided him with a temperature range for the catastrophe. Unfortunately the range was so wide that it ruled out nothing he could not have discounted already.</p>
<p>The most puzzling element of all was the timing. By his best calculations, Alexiares placed the all-consuming fire within 10 years of dates on the communication log that Pushan had retrieved from the asteroid, and which Anicetus was now dissecting below.</p>
<p>It was an odd trinity of events: the silence of the Trillion Voices, a catastrophic planet-wide burning, and an ambitious exploration of the Strands of Time by the cooperating Guardians. But the causes and effects were uncertain, and none of it explained the death of the original Alexiares and the army of nanites that had once thrived below, the decay of Anicetus, or the purposeful destruction of the archives.</p>
<p>Anicetus signaled that he had reached an impasse in his research and suggested that perhaps he would have more luck if they both focused their full energies on the data from the Strands. He reminded Alexiares that for whatever the prevailing reasons, at some time in the past, they had decided that this was the avenue that they had to pursue.</p>
<p>Alexiares agreed, and at last retreated into the ancient caverns to join his brother.</p>
<hr />
<p>Although the pair could communicate with astounding speed, Anicetus and Alexiares did not share their thoughts in the manner that Anicetus and Pushan had. Between the Guardians, the exchange of ideas was always voluntary and compartmentalized. Each avenue of thought could be offered or withheld, accepted or rejected.</p>
<p>It was an imperfect dialog, with dusting of misunderstandings and the inefficiencies of deconstructing pure thoughts into language. Of course, the language that Anicetus and Alexiares shared was not verbal- at least not in the traditional sense. The Guardians shared images, concepts and methods- language was used to fill simple gaps between these larger thoughts, and sometimes to enhance them or give them context. And the conversations were not linear or turn-based; they discussed many different things at once, always speaking over one another or interweaving their thoughts as if stitching together the patches of a quilt.</p>
<p>Their conversation now focused solely on the pattern Alexiares had discovered in the data. The records of movements on the spheres had been broken down into tables of numbers, which the pair had rendered into thousands of different incarnations. For months they had made no headway until Alexiares stumbled upon the strange logic which governed the spheres' vibrations.</p>
<p>Each sphere, no matter where it was located in the solar system, responded instantaneously and <strong>simultaneously</strong> to signals from as yet unknown stimuli. The sources of these signals could then be determined by measuring the minute differences in the magnitude of the vibrations on each sphere. Spheres closest to the source of the signal vibrated slightly more than spheres farther away. This would have been easy to discover, except for the sheer number of sources, and the fact that vibrations on the spheres tended to act as ripples on pond in a heavy rain. The simplicity of the pattern had been hidden in the chaos of hundreds of thousands of vibrations all over-lapping until there was nothing left but static.</p>
<p>On the assumption that the signals were originating from star systems, and not the dark in-betweens of empty space, Anicetus and Alexiares devised a model of the solar system which included the absolute location of each star during each moment of the data recordings. This model was cross-referenced against the relative positions of the spheres as they rotated and revolved around the local solar system, and these numbers were in turn measured against the relative size of spheres.</p>
<p>In the end, they had made some disturbing findings: thousands of years earlier when the recordings began, there had been powerful transmissions from sources in star systems scattered throughout the galaxy, but as the recordings went on, month after month, the sources disappeared one by one. By the end of the communication log, nearly three quarters of the sources had stopped transmitting. Weak signals briefly appeared that sent out bursts of data from deep, empty regions of space, before they, too were silenced.</p>
<p>Only one signal remained clear and unfettered, and it remained the greatest mystery of all, for it had no source. It affected all the spheres equally, regardless of their locations and movements. Unlike all the other transmissions (which were indecipherable torrent of gibberish), the sourceless one was an unbroken ordered stream of data with various cyclical patterns within.</p>
<p>Alexiares became obsessed with the sourceless transmission, and set about decoding it. He quickly found that the transmission seemed to be one long message- which had taken years to transmit, and then even at unheard of bandwidth. This transmission, he was certain, was the reason the entire log files had been cropped. At some time in the past, the Guardians had recognized that this segment of their observations contained a finite message which should be specially preserved and studied.</p>
<p>Alexiares realized that even for all the transmission’s complexity and verbosity, the true message it carried was even larger than it seemed. Whatever content was hiding in the transmission had been compressed and compressed and compressed until it was finally released into the universe. Alexiares set about unpacking it, and realized to his shock that the data contained within was so large that even the advanced hardware in his own body could not contain it. He appropriated the better part of the archives' storage to use as his workspace.</p>
<p>Anicetus was also intrigued by the sourceless signal, but opted to throw his efforts towards the vast symphony of transmissions from the stars. Focusing on individual sources was proving to be a challenge, however. He was unable to decipher or even isolate any single finite message of any kind. There were patterns, certainly, but they were vague and untidy. He suspected that the spheres from which all this data had been collected were not capable of picking up the nuances of the complex signals. He felt like a blind man holding a manuscript: he could run his hands over the paper and could even count the pages, but substance of the thing was impossible to discern.</p>
<p>In the end, Anicetus could only guess that beneath all the illusive patterns there were oceans of data hidden in vibrations too slight to detect. All he knew for certain was that there was a colossal communication network that was slowly falling silent, node by node.</p>
<p>'Do you believe that the Trillion Voices were such a node?' Alexiares asked when Anicetus shared his conclusions.</p>
<p>'It is a distinct possiblity.'</p>
<p>'Then it follows that there is also a distinct possibility that each node in this network is an entity similar to our Trillion Voices,' said Alexiares. 'And who better to help us revive them?'</p>
<hr />
<p>With the aid of the nanites, Anicetus's surface drone had transformed itself into a powerful observation array. Its cold eyes fixed on the slice of sky that burned with the strange new fire. If it was flickering at all, the sensors could not detect it.</p>
<p>Its increasing mass was now visibly affecting its orbit. It no longer held the steady course of the asteroid on which it was born, and on which it devoured Pushan. In less than a month it would be very close to one of the system's gas giants, and the consequences of their interaction promised to be a phenomenal show. If the growth of the new mass remained steady, it was likely to rip a moon from the orbit of the gas giant and fling it into the outskirts of the solar system.</p>
<p>The celestial encounter posed no immediate threat to Anicetus's home world, but it served as an uneasy reminder that the thing- whatever it was- was still growing, and that sooner or later it was going to be a problem.</p>
<p>There was a bright flash near the horizon and the array quickly swiveled its sensors to focus on the source.</p>
<p>In the milliseconds before the array could even focus its optics on the source, several things had happened in the caverns below. Firstly, Anicetus calculated the location of the flash on his map of the heavens and identified a star system at those coordinates. Secondly he confirmed that the star system in question was one of those that had been a source of the transmissions he'd been studying. Thirdly, he isolated the point in time when transmissions from that source had gone quiet. Fourthly, he calculated the time it would have taken for light to reach his own planet if it had left that system at the moment of the cessation of transmissions. By the time the array was fixed on its target, Anicetus had solved his mystery.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the clues had been there the whole time. Several of the stars systems from the data set were already missing from the sky. Both Alexiares and Anicetus had both set their chronometers against the heavens- but in both cases they'd only studied the sky enough to confirm the date. The absence of several stars had gone completely unnoticed.</p>
<p>It took only fractions of a second to confirm Anicetus's theory: every nearby star whose transmission had been lost early on in the data set was missing from the sky. The stars were being destroyed- one by one- wiping out entire systems.</p>
<p>'It is extremely improbable that these stars are being extinguished by natural causes. The frequency of destruction and the nature of the stars in question lead to the conclusion that an intelligence or intelligences are responsible for their absence.'</p>
<p>'An attack?' asked Alexiares. 'Are we witnessing a war?'</p>
<p>Anicetus pondered a moment. He spun the data around in his mind: a network of enlightened beings- Gods even- like the Trillion Voices coexisting in peace for eons- perhaps communicating through their network of Strands for all those millions of years, their minds and thoughts merging and mingling throughout the ages... no. This was no war. 'We are witnessing an extermination.'</p>
<p>Alexiares pondered this for a moment and then returned to his task in silence.</p>
<p>'The Trillion Voices must have gone silent before any of this data was collected', said Anicetus. 'Yet our sun is still here. I wonder why we were spared.'</p>
<p>Alexiares took on a peculiar expression and said, 'We were not spared.'</p>
<p>Before Anicetus could ask him to elaborate, he was already out the door, making his way towards the Great Machine. Anicetus followed briskly.</p>
<p>As soon as the entered the chamber, Alexiares's voice boomed out in his strange language. This time, however, he provided Anicetus with the translation- sending him the full details of his verbal language with the Trillion Voices.</p>
<p>'I know you are here,' he said.</p>
<p>There was only silence, thick and heavy.</p>
<p>'On the surface,' Alexiares continued, 'the planet was burned.'</p>
<p>Silence still.</p>
<p>'Something tried to ignite our sun, just as the others, but it didn't work. Not here. Did you stop it? Did someone else?' Alexiares said. There was something in his voice that Anicetus couldn't place. Anger?</p>
<p>Silence still.</p>
<p>'WHY WILL YOU NOT SPEAK?!' The words thundered from Alexiares at obscene decibels, and reverberated off the walls, shaking loose ancient dust particles.</p>
<p>This was rage. The anger of abandonment- the betrayal and fear and despair. Anicetus could not feel these things, but they had been welling up in Alexiares since the moment of his rebirth.</p>
<p>Silence still.</p>
<p>Alexiares extended an arm and with a twisting motion, drove it into the cavern's stone wall. Fragments of stone erupted from the impact, and bits of debris fell loose from the wall.</p>
<p>Alexiares repeated the motion, Anicetus moved towards him, but a warning glance stayed him.</p>
<p>Alexiares bashed the wall again, this time breaking off a large chunk of rock. He knelt to retrieve it, and with a final exertion, hurled it at the Great Machine. 'SPEAK!!!'</p>
<p>The rock found its target and was pulverized against the unyielding surface. A shower of pebbles fled across the floor. A cloud of dust hung in the air.</p>
<p>Silence. Still.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anicetus returned to the archives, uncertain how to proceed. If Alexiares was right, then the Trillion Voices had escaped the peril of an exploding star. But, what of the the strange explosive energy that consumed the asteroid? If it kept growing, the solar system would reach the same end. Had Anicetus set them all to the same fate that the Trillion Voices had once avoided?</p>
<p>He looked through his surface drone's eyes at the fireball in the distance. It was going to destroy the system. He was certain of it. But how long did he have?</p>
<p>There were so many factors to consider. How large could it become? Would its growth remain steady and predictable? How would it affect the orbits of the other planets and his own?</p>
<p>He had years to work with- perhaps decades... he would need to keep monitoring the monster as it grew. But what to do with the time?</p>
<p>Escape would be necessary, eventually. An interstellar craft, large enough to carry another Pushan-sized probe or two, and enough nanites to make a start someplace else. An interstellar craft would take time, to construct, however... and it was not a science that his people had mastered.</p>
<p>He drafted schematics and ran simulations in his mind until he was satisfied that he had designed a reliable spacecraft. It would be easy to build, and not terribly time consuming. He had a contingent of nanites near ore deposits on the surface begin the preliminary work.</p>
<p>Alexiares spoke as he entered the room. He was no longer communicating verbally, but rather through their more efficient methods. 'The two of us fleeing the system will not save the Trillion Voices.'</p>
<p>Anicetus had not shared his plan. Alexiares must have deduced it by observing Anicetus requisition order to the nanites.</p>
<p>Anicetus said, 'I agree, but perhaps in the interim we will find other archives like the one that stored your mind. Perhaps we can rebuild something on a distant world. Is it not better to prepare for an escape now and decide the rest as events demand?</p>
<p>Alexiares responded slowly, he was already resuming his work on the sourceless message. 'You are correct, but what I meant was that we need to take the Trillion Voices with us.'</p>
<p>Anicetus was puzzled. 'Are you proposing that we transport the Great Machine?'</p>
<p>'I am,' said Alexiares.</p>
<p>'But that is impossible,' said Anicetus, sharing a thousand simulations that he had just concocted for bring the Great Machine to the surface and then into orbit. 'You can see here that it is simply too large to move in the time allotted.'</p>
<p>Alexiares said, 'We must try.'</p>
<p>Anicetus shared a schematic of an orbital lifter which could house the Great Machine. It would take decades to build, far beyond the estimated lifetime of the planet if the fiery beast grew steadily.</p>
<p>Alexiares said, 'We must try.'</p>
<hr />
<p>At once every nanite and drone on the surface of the planet halted, paused, then began to swarm back to the cavern entrances. A grand new construction project had begun.</p>
<hr />
<p>It had been months since the nanites had started on the framework, and a dozen revisions had already been made to the plan. Anicetus and Alexiares had shaved years off of the task through clever redesign and the decision to poach the Great Clock for parts and refined materials. If their ingenuity persisted in shaving production time, they might yet escape the system before it was consumed.</p>
<p>Always, though, they were haunted by the menacing light in the sky, looking now like a distant star.</p>
<p>Alexiares remained in the archive room endlessly analyzing the sourceless message. Days ago he had finally finished decompressing the huge code, taking up most of the archive's vast storage space in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the compression itself had been somewhat obvious and intuitive, Alexiares reported that the actual raw data within seemed to be gibberish, without any semblance of a pattern or order of any kind.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Alexiares declared that the data in the archives had actually <strong>changed</strong> since he had decompressed it and that he suspected that the archive itself was not completely repaired as Anicetus had reported. Anicetus transmitted his complete memory of the repair job and the matter was dropped. He suspected that Alexiares's emotions had led him to become irrational- something which he would bring to his attention if the behavior persisted.</p>
<p>Anicetus was inspecting the supports that held the Great Machine, and debating how best to detach them, when he was interrupted by Alexiares. 'Look at this' he requested from afar, and sent Anicetus a series of images from the archives.</p>
<p>Alexiares had removed the protective cover from the archive's massive data crystals. Usually perfectly transparent, the crystals now had a grayish hue about them, and in one corner of the crystal array, thin tendrils like fine light thread snaked out from dark mass. It looked rather like a jelly fish frozen in a block of ice.</p>
<p>Anicetus was puzzled. 'What are we looking at?' he asked. 'Shall I join you?'</p>
<p>'No. Please stay where you are', Alexiares signaled back. 'I am attempting to use the raw data from the archive reader as a magnifier.'</p>
<p>In moments Alexiares sent Anicetus a visual data feed from the archive scanner. It found an impurity in the crystal and focused on what appeared to be a snowflake. Having acquired a region of interest, Alexiares increased the magnification.</p>
<p>The archive's crystal structure had been altered somehow to create an elegant geometric pattern. The artifact was asymmetrical and seemed to have spontaneously formed out of the fine lattice structure that formed the backbone of the crystal array.</p>
<p>The image then shifted as Alexiares focused the reader's optics onto one of the fine tendrils. This picture was a curious as the first: more crystalline patterns could be seen, but they had a fine symmetry to them. Following the tendril to its end, they could actually see the healthy archive crystals being slowly unstitched from their lattice and sequestered into the alien pattern. The mechanism of crystallization here seemed to be a natural, self-sustaining process.</p>
<p>The reader moved again, following the tendril up to its source. What they saw there was impossible.</p>
<p>An army of nanites churned inside the crystals manipulating them to unknown ends. Next to the cluster was a fine mechanical structure made entirely from the surrounding crystals and composed with such fine precision and complexity that it put the clockwork overhead to shame.</p>
<p>Somehow the inanimate crystal array had been transformed into a dynamic and impossibly elaborate machine. Even with all his people's technical marvels, Anicetus had never seen anything like this.</p>
<p>'How did those nanites get in there?' Anicetus asked. 'And how did they build that fantastic machinery?'</p>
<p>Alexiares response was hesitant: 'I think that fantastic machinery ... built them.'</p>
<hr />
<p>'I don't understand,' Anicetus transmitted back. 'If not the nanites, then who built that crystalline machine? I designed those data crystals to standard specifications when I restored the archive.'</p>
<p>Alexiares said simply, 'I believe that the machine created itself.'</p>
<p>Anicetus was not amused by Alexiares's elusive brevity. 'Will you share your thoughts?' he requested.</p>
<p>Alexiares did not respond for a moment, and when he did it was only to say, 'I think that would not be wise at this time.'</p>
<p>Anicetus was about to protest when his thoughts were interrupted by a series of strange commands that Alexiares was broadcasting to the nanites and drones. He had sent the whole lot of them a simple request to halt all activity and report their location- a mere polling of there numbers. But why take a census right now now? What was Alexiares doing?</p>
<p>The machines all answered back- the nanites numbered in the trillions, and they were scattered all over the surface of the planet and deep in the caverns as expected.</p>
<p>'May I be of assistance, Alexiares?' Anicetus asked. Without waiting for an answer he started towards the archives.</p>
<p>'No.' Alexiares transmitted. 'Please remain where you are.'</p>
<p>Alexiares waited a minute and conducted a second census of the nanites.</p>
<p>Their numbers had decreased by several hundred.</p>
<p>Another minute went by, and Alexiares polled the nanites again.</p>
<p>Several hundred more were missing.</p>
<p>Anicetus listened to Alexiares's dialog with the nanites and was puzzled. 'What does this mean?'</p>
<p>'It means that we're under attack.'</p>
<hr />
<p>It took a moment for Anicetus to realize the magnificence of it, and when he did, he shuddered to imagine the intellect behind it.</p>
<p>The code Alexiares had been deciphering <strong>was</strong> gibberish in the sense that there was never anything sensible within it to be read. The code was designed for a solitary purpose: to be stored inside a crystalline data structure.</p>
<p>The mere act of recording the data within the crystal was enough to spring the trap. The genius- the unparalleled genius of the design was that it took advantage of the arrangement of atoms within the crystals which somehow resulted in physical movement.</p>
<p>Arrange enough moving parts in a clever assembly and you are able to create something larger and more complicated. And so they had- until they were left with a device which could create nanites out of raw crystal. The recursive logic was maddening to comprehend. There was no mistaking it- whatever created that signal created life from lifeless matter. If this was not the signature of a God, than what was?</p>
<p>But what luck for them, that Anicetus just happened to be using a crystal data structure of just the right configuration to be invaded by the subversive data? No- there were only two possibilities: either this trap was designed specifically for them by an enemy who knew them well, or the code itself was orders of magnitude more complicated than in appeared, and was versatile enough to attack several types of storage systems. Both scenarios seemed equally plausible given the improbability of the trap to begin with.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why Alexiares did not want to share his thoughts? Had he begun to wonder if he himself was infected by this strange code? He had spent countless hours processing the data and storing it in his own mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly it all became clear. This attack, had happened before. <strong>This</strong> is what had left the cavern in ruins, and Alexiares dead, and Anicetus in decay.</p>
<p>Anicetus tried to recreate the events in his mind:</p>
<p>A vast network of cultures all lived in peace communicating through the Strands of Time, until one day they started dying as their stars were destroyed, one by one. The Trillion Voices came under attack- the sun heating up until the planet's surface was scorched. But somehow the attack ceased before the sun or the planet were destroyed.</p>
<p>The Trillion Voices fell silent then, and Alexiares and Anicetus were forced to awaken them. Their quest inevitably led to the vault and the asteroid, where they found the encased strand frozen and vibrant. Alexiares must have had the good sense to dissuade Anicetus from interacting with the Strand until it was thoroughly studied, negating the catastrophe that Pushan would later cause when he touched the Strand.</p>
<p>So Alexiares and Anicetus had monitored the spheres and created the data logs that Pushan later rescued- storing them in the vault, compressed and doing no harm.</p>
<p>Back in the caverns they must have untangled the data and watched it consume the archives, unaware of the magnitude of the threat, or even the knowledge that it was a threat at all.</p>
<p>The final piece was difficult to recreate. At some point they had decided to destroy the archives, shattering it to damage the fine crystal lattice and therefore stop the delicate machine inside from churning out more of the foreign nanites. When Anicetus had found Alexiares's memory core, it had been damaged beyond salvation. So it was likely that they had either found evidence that the destructive code in Alexiares's mind, or that had calculated that the risk itself was so great that it demanded decisive action, and destroyed the memory core.</p>
<p>The only mystery left was why they had found it necessary to move Anicetus's memory core into Alexiares body.</p>
<p>Alexiares intruded on Anicetus's thoughts, showing him an image of five nanites attacking one of the foreign intruders. The crystalline-born nanite easily bested the lot of them, and began scavenging its foes for useful components.</p>
<p>'These nanites are going to be a problem,' Alexiares commented.</p>
<p>Anicetus agreed and relayed his hypothesis about their present predicament, and how it was all likely a repeat of events that had happened before. Alexiares quickly concurred, and before Anicetus could even formally request it, Alexiares began pulverizing the archives.</p>
<hr />
<p>'The last time this happened, you woke up to cavern devoid of nanites,' Alexiares said. 'Which leads me to conclude that we must have decided to purge them at some point. Even if these new nanites were more powerful, our nanites must have outnumbered them at ratios of millions to one.'</p>
<p>'Indeed,' said Anicetus. 'A stasis field would have disabled all of the nanites, ours and theirs.'</p>
<p>Alexiares said, 'It would have disabled us as well. Unless we were already deactivated.'</p>
<p>'I believe that we took refuge in my stasis compartment, remaining shielded while a stasis field was made operation in the caverns,' said Anicetus</p>
<p>'But that hardly seems necessary,' said Alexiares. 'Even if we didn't recognize the danger of the nanites until we were overrun, surely we would have simply used isolated nanites on the far side of the planet to construct new bodies for ourselves. We could have copied our memories to them, and left these bodies to rot.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Anicetus, thoughtfully. 'That's exactly what we would have done.'</p>
<p>'In fact,' he continued, 'I believe that that's exactly what we did.'</p>

<h3 id="prologue-the-withdrawal---part-i">Prologue: The Withdrawal - Part I</h3>
<p>Charles Matthew Banks of 137 Eldridge Lane, Smithfield, Pennsylvania, tried to extract the debit card from his wallet. His nervous fingers slid uselessly over the plastic, too sweaty and shaky to find purchase. He cursed to himself and threw an apprehensive glance skyward. He squinted, seeing nothing but stars beyond the harsh fluorescent lights of the ATM awning.</p>
<p>Behind him, his white SUV purred, driver’s side door open, headlights aglow. It was an old, reliable Ford Fusion, which had been well cared for. In his back seat was a hastily packed suitcase, containing underwear and socks mostly, as well as a couple of sweaters, a pair of dirty jeans, and some hiking boots. The trunk of the car was filled with bottled water, granola bars, flour, rice, sugar, beans, assorted canned goods, and all the shelf-stable snacks he was able to get his hands on at the gas station/24-hour convenience store.</p>
<p>Charles wiped his damp hands on his slacks, and tried again to pry the card free from the stiff leather. He succeeded, and jammed the card into the ATM with more force than was necessary. He entered his PIN and tried to withdraw a thousand dollars. The frustratingly dim screen informed him that this amount exceeded his account’s daily limit, which set him into a cursing fit.</p>
<p>In his pocket his smartphone buzzed. His hand reflexively jolted to his thigh with the sort of practiced speed and agility that once only belonged to gunfighters. But shy of diving into the pocket his conscious mind stayed the movement. He was too busy for this shit.</p>
<p>...on the other hand, this was the third call in the past five minutes, and he knew he’d catch hell if he didn’t pick it up. He fumbled for a moment and then brought the phone to his ear.</p>
<p>“God dammit, Sharon,” he said, “I’m moving as a fast as I can here!”</p>
<p>This was not a wise tone to take, he realized, as Sharon was apparently in no mood to be sassed.</p>
<p>“Charlie Banks,” she said coolly, “you had better reconsider how you talk to your fancy.”</p>
<p>She meant ‘fiancee’, but more often than not, her accent and impressive lack of education conspired to turn the word into ‘fancy’ before it hit Charles’s ear. He had tried to correct her for a time, but eventually decided that it sounded quite charming. However, in this particular instance, it didn’t take any of the prickliness out of her voice.</p>
<p>“I know,” he said, after a deep and deliberate breath. “I’m sorry baby. I just - I’m in a hurry here so what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Well,” she said, “while you’re out picking up your bottled water and whatnot, would you please get some more half-and-half?”</p>
<p>Charles took the phone away from his ear and looked at it in disbelief, as if the phone itself had said something stupid. His mouth tried to form words, but for a moment he was rendered mute.</p>
<p>Then he said, “Woman, have you lost your damned mind?”</p>
<p>She began an indignant protest, but he cut her off at the first syllable. “Listen here-- I am trying to get <em>emergency</em> supplies, because we are in a god damned <em>emergency.</em> Half-and-half is not an <em>emergency</em> item.”</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end of the line, wherein Charles was picturing Sharon, bested by his scolding outburst, mouth twisted, tongue stayed, in an expression of reluctant surrender. He was, however, too agitated to stop his rant.</p>
<p>“Water. Dried foods. Medicine. Gasoline. Batteries. <em>Those</em> are emergency supplies. Not goddamned half-and-half. Now I’m coming home in five minutes, and two minutes after that, we’re leaving for the cabin, so get all your stuff by the door and get yourself ready. And I don’t want to hear another word about it!”</p>
<p>Feeling the short-sighted satisfaction that only comes from deliciously cowing a loved one, he hung up the phone without waiting for a reply. Returning his attention to the ATM, he withdrew five-hundred dollars without a problem, and bounced impatiently while the machine counted out his money. When it was done, he scooped a pile of twenties directly into his coat pocket instead of trying to squeeze it into his wallet.</p>
<p>“You can just give that right here,” said a voice behind him.</p>
<p>Charles spun around too quickly, scraping his back painfully on the ATM’s jutting corner. A skinny man stood several feet away. He wore baggy cargo pants, and a red sweatshirt with a tightly-drawn hood. In the man’s hand was a small revolver.</p>
<p>“Wha-what?” Charles said, stupidly.</p>
<p>“Do I look like I’m playing around, Jack?” said the skinny man.</p>
<p>To Charles’s ears the voice sounded high-strung and manic. It was not the voice of a calm and experienced hoodlum. Charles wasn’t sure if that was a point working in his favor or not.</p>
<p>Charles removed the wad of cash, still folded neatly in his sweaty hand. “Here,” he said, “take it all.”</p>
<p>The skinny man hesitated for a moment. He seemed nervous to the point of being frightened, appearing to consider if stepping forward to take the money was the best idea. What was he worried about? He had the gun, after all.</p>
<p>The mugger’s hesitation made Charles wonder the same thing, and for the briefest moment, Charles imagined stepping forward and grabbing the revolver. It was a silly, thought, of course, of the fleeting, intrusive variety. He wouldn’t really do anything so stupid. After all, it was only money.</p>
<p>But it was too late. The skinny man had seen something threatening in Charles’s body language or in his eyes. Charles opened his mouth to say something, but that only acted as a catalyst for the brewing disaster. In an instant of nervous panic, the skinny man pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The hammer fell. The primer exploded. The gunpowder ignited.</p>
<p>The bullet rocketed from the short barrel, riding a tongue of fire. In a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a second, the bullet would travel from the barrel of the gun, directly into Charles Matthew Banks’s right temple.</p>
<p>This was how Charles’s life was going to end. This was the closing shot of the series finale. And Charles would not even have the briefest of moments to contemplate that his life was over. The bullet would be in his brain before he had time to register the gunshot.</p>
<p>In a moment, blood and gore would splatter against the wall behind him. His blood. His gore. His body would go limp and collapse in an undignified pile, where it it would spasm under the demented puppetry of a broken brain.</p>
<p>This was inevitable. The events were in motion. This was written.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>But, before this extraordinary moment could come to pass, something wholly unprecedented happened.</p>
<p>A wave a darkness fell from above. It was death. It was instantaneous. It was total.</p>
<p>From high orbit, it pulsed down through the atmosphere, passing through planes, birds, insects, tree tops, and down, deep into the ground. And where the darkness penetrated, all life was extinguished.</p>
<p>Charles Matthew Banks was a corpse before the bullet tore through his brain. So too was the skinny man whose finger still squeezed the trigger. Both men fell to the ground simultaneously.</p>
<p>The rest of this story you already know. The bodies lay on the ground, unmolested by scavengers, passing flies, or even microbes. They did not bloat or rot, or start to stink. They just lay in the dark until the next morning, and the morning after that, and so on and so on--through the years.</p>
<p>The elements tested them. The wind scoured them, the sun dried them, the rain soaked them. The snow buried them.</p>
<p>They froze. They thawed. They dehydrated into mummified husks.</p>
<p>For years, storms and winds battered them with debris and broke off digits and limbs. The sun bleached their papery skin, and blowing sand eroded them. In the end we all return to dust.</p>
<p>Before the Earth could claim the corpses entirely, a carpet of red slime crept in from over the horizon to cover whatever bits of carrion remained. Nutrients were consumed. The alien ooze reproduced and expanded. Not a single trace of the corpses remained.</p>
<p>You might expect that this concludes the story of Charles Matthew Banks. But this is not the story of a man. This is a story of a wrathful god.</p>
<h3 id="part-i-kyle-chapter-1---life-on-earth">Part I: Kyle / Chapter 1 - Life on Earth</h3>
<p>Sushi was a problem. I had always been a good sport, going to sushi restaurants when invited, but for years I’d only ever order the California roll. California rolls contained cooked seafood, which was good, because raw seafood could have all sorts of nasty bacteria or parasites. The trouble was that I knew that the sushi chefs were cutting my California rolls with the same knives they used to cut the raw tuna rolls. Cross contamination. I tried not to think about it.</p>
<p>As a general principle, attractive women can talk me into just about anything. Consequently, an ex of mine eventually convinced me to eat raw tuna in a sushi roll. It was actually quite tasty, and thereafter I ate raw fish with abandon. In the back of my mind, I knew I’d pay for it someday. Food poisoning is no fun at all.</p>
<p>Bacterial meningitis--now that’s a scary one. Forget E. Coli or Salmonella, usually those would just give you the runs. Meningitis would swell your brain and leave you dead or paralyzed or blind or any of a dozen other nasty things.</p>
<p>I looked at the guinea pig in my latex-sheathed hands and marvelled at its fragility and helplessness. I’d never had a pet of any kind, but I’d held dogs and cats before. Those animals were substantial and hardy, but this rodent could be snuffed out of existence at my merest whim. The slightest squeeze would end it. I wouldn’t even have to strain at the effort.</p>
<p>The thought disturbed me. More troubling was the knowledge that I might just as easily kill it through negligence. It was the worry of a man who was unexpectedly handed an expensive piece of fine china. I wanted to set it down; to abdicate responsibility.</p>
<p>I returned the guinea pig to his cage as gently as I could manage. It occurred to me that I ought to give him a name. I meditated on it for a moment, but nothing special came to mind. This would the first being I’d ever named--best to wait a while and get it right.</p>
<p>I stripped off the gloves and discarded them. My fingers had pruned and picked up an unpleasant chemical smell. I shook my head as I looked at my hands.</p>
<p>Looking at the gloves, I did, on some level, recognize how crazy I was. A rabid guinea pig? Honestly.</p>
<p>I should explain. You see, I’d found the guinea pig abandoned in the woods. I would have left him in the woods, except there was this girl. And she said, “Kyle, I will love you forever if you rescue that guinea pig. I would do it, except my cats would eat him.”</p>
<p>And so now I had a guinea pig. But it might have rabies. I mean, not really. But maybe. Did something rabid bite it after it was abandoned in the woods? So anyway, I won’t touch it without wearing gloves.</p>
<p>I’ve often suspected that I would have been happier as a caveman, never knowing about things like germs, radiation, lead poisoning, and so on. I mean, sure, my expected lifespan would have been somewhere around 32 years, but it’s not like I would have been aware of that statistic. Wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world where you were blissfully ignorant of all the horrible things that were trying to kill you?</p>
<p>I watched him happily munch on the carrots I’d put in his cage. I think I gave him too much. How much does a guinea pig eat?</p>
<p>“Do you like comedies?” I ask him.</p>
<p>He didn’t look up from his carrot.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I thought so.”</p>
<p>I turned on the TV and started browsing through the Netflix offerings.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I awoke disoriented, finding myself on the couch, a small puddle of drool soaked into the fabric around my mouth. My phone was vibrating on the coffee table, making a ghastly rattling noise. It was quite dark outside, and I couldn’t guess how many hours I’d been out. I didn’t remember falling asleep..</p>
<p>Sitting upright, I left a me-shaped indentation in the couch cushions. I grabbed the phone and looked at it through bleary eyes. I registered the icons informing me that I had missed several calls and text messages. I cleared my throat and accepted the call from a number I didn’t recognized.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Kyle! What are you doing right now?” it was a male voice--a bit too chipper for my taste.</p>
<p>“Um, is this an attempt to collect a debt?”</p>
<p>“It’s Chen!” said the caller.</p>
<p>I only knew one Chen. We were work friends. We were not call-in-the-middle-of-the-night friends.</p>
<p>“Chen?” I said, “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer right away. I heard considerable commotion on his side of the call. After ten seconds or so he returned his attention to me, saying, “You still want that job?”</p>
<p>That job. THAT job. Of course I wanted THAT job.</p>
<p>“What? Yeah, of course. You got me an interview?”</p>
<p>“Better. I got you some freelance. But you have to get here right now.”</p>
<p>I looked at the clock on my microwave. “It’s two in the morning.”</p>
<p>I heard a voice speaking loudly but distantly on Chen’s side of the call. Chen was distracted for another long moment, then said, “Get down here as soon as you can. We have some equipment that needs fixing.”</p>
<p>“That’s... that’s... good. Great. But I don’t fix equipment... Hello? Chen? Chen? Buddy?”</p>
<p>I waited as he finished an unintelligible conversation on his end.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said. To me. I think.</p>
<p>“I said, I don’t fix equipment,” I repeated.</p>
<p>“You can fix this. But we need you down here right now.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay,” I said. “Where’s ‘here’ though?”</p>
<p>He gave me the address and I googled it.</p>
<p>“I’m an hour and half away.”</p>
<p>“Okay, said Chen. Call me on this line when you’re close.”</p>
<p>It took a second for Chen’s offer to actually register in my mind. When it did, I exhibited an appropriate amount of enthusiasm, saying, “I mean-- that’s awesome! Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t imagine what it was they needed me to repair, or why Chen thought that I was the man to do it. However, I’d been trying to get my foot in the door at PILT ever since Chen got a job there, so I wasn’t about to pass up the invitation. Even if I couldn’t fix what they needed, I’d still get a chance to shake some hands and maybe impress a few of the right people. Chen, for his part, seemed too preoccupied with whatever was happening on his end of things to care about the gratitude I was so carefully emoting.</p>
<p>“I live about three hours away,” I calculated. “I can be there by nine if I leave early tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Huh? No. We need you tonight,” said Chen. There was a sharp urgency in his voice that was unnatural in someone as chronically laid-back as him.</p>
<p>I was thinking about how to respond to this when my phone notified me that my brother was trying to dial in. I sent him to voicemail.</p>
<p>“Uh, okay. Sure. Tonight,” I said. “But, what’s the rush?”</p>
<p>Chen said, “There’s something coming that we need pictures of. Check out the news and then get here as soon as you can.”</p>
<p>My phone beeped again. It was my mother this time. I sent her to voicemail as well.</p>
<p>“What could possibly be so urgent at a telescope observatory?” I asked, and then in a tone that was only half jest, “is an asteroid about to destroy the Earth or something?”</p>
<p>“Turn on the news!” he said, impatiently.</p>
<p>But even as he spoke the words, my television was flickering with images of an excited reporter and a news ticker saying things that I couldn’t believe.</p>
<p>“Any channel.” he said. “I’ll see you tonight. Call me if you need help finding the place.”</p>
<p>He said a hasty goodbye. I didn’t. My jaw was frozen open.</p>
<p>Chen’s line disconnected, and my phone, still at my ear, began to vibrate again. It was my brother dialing back.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize I’d answered until I heard him ask, “Are you seeing this!?”</p>
<h3 id="part-i-kyle-chapter-2---down">Part I: Kyle / Chapter 2 - Down</h3>
<p>The roads were clear at this late hour, more so than usual, I suspected. I imagined that most everybody was at home flipping between news channels. What little traffic I did see had an odd flavor to it. People were driving faster than usual. Nearly every driver had a phone to their ear.</p>
<p>I was speeding, as I usually did, but found that I was being passed with unusual frequency. Everything felt a bit surreal, as if the air itself was buzzing with the shared energy of a nervous and excited populous. I was not allowing myself to get wrapped up in all the fuss. This wasn’t so much an exercise in self-control as it was my natural skepticism keeping me from having too much fun. Unbelievable news reports ought to remain unbelieved.</p>
<p>The PILT Observatory was waiting in a sleepy part of upstate New York. The facility had never gained the notoriety of the CERN Large Hadron Collider, the Hubble Telescope or other scientific wonders, but in certain circles it was equally revered. I knew little about it other than that it paid its IT workers and technicians ridiculously well.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what PILT stands for, you’ve come to a dubious source. To the best of my recollection, it was the Probability Inference Lightless Telescope, but even as I relay this, I am almost certain I am wrong. At one time, I’m sure that the name was embossed with perfect clarity on my mind, but it’s faded since then.</p>
<p>I recall seeing an illustrated cutaway of the facility once in a popular science magazine. It was reminiscent of super-villain’s lair. An unassuming building sat atop a concealed shaft; a tunnel that ran deep into the earth. At the bottom of the shaft was a detection room, which was surrounded on all sides by massive tanks of fluid. The accompanying article had explained that the setup was designed to block out various types of background radiation, leaving whatever sensors they had down there free to detect... well... I couldn’t remember that bit. Cosmic rays, maybe?</p>
<p>The rather bizarre fellow who had set me racing to the observatory was a former coworker of mine. Chen and I had worked in a medical imaging department of a hospital for a while, until a couple years ago when he’d been recruited by PILT to do some type of data analysis. We’d shared an office once, and got along well. Our friendship never extended beyond the workplace, but I was looking forward to seeing him again.</p>
<p>As I drove, I was listening to the local NPR station. Usually at this time of night they would be playing classical music or something equally sedate. This being no ordinary night, however, I listened as a reporter joined a news anchor in the studio.</p>
<p>The anchorman said, “Now, I understand there have been developments in this story, Christine?”</p>
<p>Christine said, “Yes there have, Don. A spokesperson from NASA released a statement about five minutes ago confirming that the object seems to be slowing down.”</p>
<p>The anchor’s voice was full of skepticism and surprise: “Did I hear that right, Christine? Did you say slowing down? In space?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Christine. “NASA said they’d be making an additional statement about it shortly, but that at the moment, they aren’t going to speculate publicly.”</p>
<p>Don said, “Is it slowing down because it’s hitting the atmosphere?”</p>
<p>Christine said, “The NASA statement didn’t mention anything about the atmosphere, and if earlier reports were correct, we wouldn’t expect the object to reach Earth for another several hours yet.”</p>
<p>Don paused a moment to formulate his followup, “So, this is an object that is slowing down on its own? Is there any precedent for that? Any asteroids or comets that do that?”</p>
<p>Christine said, “I’ve been corresponding on science stories for over a decade, and I can’t recall ever hearing about something like that, but I’m not an authority on the matter, and I would hate to speculate.”</p>
<p>This, of course, was the story that had been breaking on every news channel on the dial tonight. Something strange was headed towards us--something strange enough that NASA was making a royal fuss about it. As with all news stories where the facts are sparse, the major networks filled their airtime with nonsense while waiting for the real details to unfold.</p>
<p>In between the hysteria, fear-mongering, and unfounded speculation, I’d pieced together the following facts: An object was spotted in space. It was large, but not killed-all-the-dinosaurs large. It was headed towards the Earth, and was certainly going to hit us. There would likely be a spectacular light show, and, yes- the possibility of serious, but localized destruction.</p>
<p>This latest bit--that the object was slowing down--now that was interesting. That sounded like the stuff of science fiction. But then, what did we <em>really</em> know? NASA didn’t say <em>how much</em> the object was slowing down. Was it a drastic slowdown, like a spaceship slamming on the brakes? That’s what the sci-fi fan inside me wanted to believe.</p>
<p>More likely, the object was slowing down by a fraction of a fraction of smidgen--some icy part of a meteor evaporating in the sunlight and creating a geyser of water shooting backwards against the trajectory of the thing. NASA, bless their hearts, was always trying to make things sound more exciting than they actually were. They’d been doing that ever since we got to the moon and let out a collective groan when we found out it wasn’t made of cheese. Can’t blame them, though. It’s not their fault that space is boring.</p>
<p>Most every telescope on the planet was pointed at the distant, blurry dot--far too small to be seen with the naked eye at this point. The media had gotten hold of some images. Even under high magnification it just looked like a fuzzy, shiny blob. Or so they said. I’d hopped in the car minutes after Chen hung up on me. They hadn’t had any pictures then.</p>
<p>It was well past two in the morning when my GPS informed me that I’d arrived at my destination. I felt surprisingly awake as I pulled into the parking lot. I’d spent the entire drive being fueled by the thought that I was one of the few people on the planet who was actually able to <em>do</em> something in this situation. I was going to help fix some equipment so that we could get a better look at whatever it was up there. At least, that’s what I thought Chen was asking me to do.</p>
<p>Stepping out of my car, I found Chen’s number in my phone’s call history. I rang him, and he promised he’d be out to meet me in under a minute. Although it was quite dark, I was certain that I’d seen all there was to see of the outside of the facility: A squat brick building, two stories high, with an ugly plastic sign identifying it and its acting director whose name I took note of, but now can’t begin to recall.</p>
<p>The air was filled with the pleasant sting of freshly cut grass and the fragrant white blossoms of a bush I didn’t recognize. In the moonlight I could see a farm of some sort across the road. A couple of lightning bugs were blinking in and out of existence near the edge of the lit parking lot.</p>
<p>A large Chinese man burst through a set of doors off to my right with enough energy to startle me. He’d lost a good thirty pounds or so, but there was no mistaking him. Chen was his last name, but I’d been calling him by it for so long that I’d forgotten his first. “Chen, buddy!” I said, warmly. “Great to see you, man!”</p>
<p>He stood about two inches taller than me, with short, straight black hair that spiked up from his head as if it were trying to escape. Thinner now than when I had worked with him, he was still a bulky guy; fat, yes, but also very muscular. Under a cheap button-down shirt, his pale skin was smooth and clean, not as I remembered it, pock-marked with acne.</p>
<p>“You got fat,” he said. But then he smiled, shook my hand, and gave me a tastefully brief guy-hug, during which he whispered, “Don’t grab my ass or anything. I know about you.”</p>
<p>That was Chen for you.</p>
<p>“You know I’ve always wanted you,” I said. I would meet his every raunchy barb or innuendo. If you let yourself be embarrassed by him, he’d lay it on thicker.</p>
<p>“You complete me,” he said, with an excellent deadpan. He used to say that to me all the time when we worked together at the hospital. I gave him a polite chuckle.</p>
<p>He brought me into the PILT observatory through the side entrance. The hallways were industrial and ugly--no big surprise. In my experience, most research facilities didn’t waste time on comfort or aesthetics.</p>
<p>Chen walked me briskly down a short corridor, twice stopping briefly to introduce me to distracted-looking colleagues. Eventually we came to an employee lounge, where a small crowd had gathered around a wall-mounted television. I wondered if this place was always so busy at night, or if everyone had come in to help spot the... the... whatever it was in space.</p>
<p>On the television screen there was an ongoing press conference. I didn’t recognize the speaker, but the marquee on the screen told me that it was a NASA official. As we approached, the crowd hushed me and Chen before we could even say a word.</p>
<p>I squeezed into the group where I could, and listened with interest, catching the speaker mid-sentence: "-for about an hour. Our readings have been confirmed by independent sources, and at this time, we calculate that the object will pass close to the Earth in approximately three hours.</p>
<p>“I want to stress again that we have no reason to expect a collision at this time. However, we are intrigued and frankly quite surprised by the course change. There is very little doubt at this time that the object we call UR-1373 is in fact being directed by some intelligence.”</p>
<p>There was a sudden eruption of sound both in the press briefing on the television and among the small crowd around me. Both were silenced when the the NASA spokeswoman raised her hands to indicate she had more to say on the subject.</p>
<p>"We are contacting all space-faring nations and private corporations that may have any information about this object, but due to its size and initial trajectory; it is unlikely that it is of Earth origin.</p>
<p>“I wish I could give you more details, but until it gets a little closer, I’m afraid we don’t know much more. I’ll take some questions now, but I ask you wait until I call on you….”</p>
<p>The press conference erupted into questions, but no more useful information could be garnered. The employees in the lounge looked at each other with shocked eyes. Chen said, “Whoa… that is deep stuff.”</p>
<p>I’d almost forgotten about it, but hearing Chen now I was reminded that there had always been a detached quality about him. When commenting on something grave, he gave the impression that he was saying what he thought people expected him to say, and not expressing any genuine emotion. Even now, faced with news of what was possibly an alien object visiting Earth, I had the distinct impression that Chen was nonplussed.</p>
<p>I didn’t have time to process my own reaction before an angry looking brown-haired woman her mid-thirties spun around and said, “Aaron, how long until we can get a look at that thing?”</p>
<p>She noticed me and gave a quizzical look. I expected her to inquire about who I was and what I was doing here, but she either already knew, or didn’t care. I don’t remember finding her particularly attractive at first glance. Her features were sharp, and there was a fierce intensity in her manner. She had an interesting face which suggested mediterranean heritage.</p>
<p>Chen said, “Hey boss, this is Kyle. He’s going to fix our server right now. In the meantime, do we know where to look yet?”</p>
<p>From an office just out of view, someone answered, “I’m calling my guy over there right now. I’ll have your coordinates by the time you get down there.”</p>
<p>Chen and the brown-haired woman started walking away. Chen didn’t stop as he called over his shoulder, “You coming, slow poke?”</p>
<p>I jogged a few steps to catch up to them. We got to an elevator where Chen swiped his badge through a card reader. The doors opened to reveal a surprisingly unsturdy-looking cage. The other two got in quickly. I hesitated for only a moment and stepped in, feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>A hand stopped the doors as they began to shut behind me. It was an older man with a thick walrus-like mustache. His expression was hard to read--in no small part because of the monster on his upper lip. But his eyes seemed angry to me.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” he said to the woman. “You pulled me out here on tonight of all nights so that I can sit my office while the new kid gets array access?”</p>
<p>I thought for a moment that he was referring to me, but Chen said, “Don’t be bitter, Phil. It’s not because I’m more talented. It’s because I’m better looking.”</p>
<p>Phil’s expression didn’t change, but he allowed his eyes to flash towards Chen for a moment before resting on the woman again.</p>
<p>She said, “Phil, I pulled everyone out here tonight--not just you. This is a team effort.”</p>
<p>Phil opened his mouth, but she cut him off before he could protest. “If you you want to be in the bat cave tonight, come down after you’ve finished the spectral analysis.”</p>
<p>I flashed Chen a quizzical look and mouthed, “Bat cave?”. Chen just shook his head dismissively.</p>
<p>Phil said, “I’m not sitting this one out.”</p>
<p>An awkward pause followed as the woman stared at Phil with an expression I couldn’t read. Then, after an uncomfortable moment, Phil and his mustache let the lift doors close.</p>
<p>An uncomfortable silence ensued, broken only when Chen cleared his throat and held his badge to the control panel. “Going down?” he asked.</p>
<p>I looked down at the grate we were standing on. Below I could see nothing but an infinite blackness. If Chen was bothered by the bottomless pit, he certainly didn’t show it. “Neat, huh?” was all he said.</p>
<p>The elevator jerked to life. Now, with what I assumed would be a several-minute descent in front of us, the woman turned to Chen and said, “So, who is this now?”</p>
<p>Chen said, “This is my old co-worker that I’ve been telling you about--Kyle. He taught me everything I know about Linux system administration. He’s going to get us up and running, and If we’re lucky, maybe we’ll get him to work for us.”</p>
<p>The woman shook my hand and said, “Well then, Kyle, let’s hope you’re as good as he says you are. I’m Karen, by the way.”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Karen is the head boss-lady.”</p>
<p>“<em>Assistant</em> head boss-lady,” she corrected.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you,” I said. “I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>The elevator moved fairly quickly, I thought, but it was hard to gauge the speed. There was nothing but darkness below and above us, and only a couple of tiny bulbs illuminated the lift itself.</p>
<p>By my best estimate, the descent took nearly twenty minutes, and I found my ears popping many times along the way. The pressure change made me feel rather uncomfortable, and I began to wonder if you could get the bends from such a trip, or if that could only happen while scuba diving.</p>
<p>I had thought we would pass the time by speculating on the mysterious object floating out to meet the Earth, but almost immediately Karen began talking excitedly to Chen about the technical details involved in repositioning their sensor array. I understood very little of what they were saying, and stood mute in the corner.</p>
<p>When we did eventually come to a stop, the doors opened to reveal a dimly lit hallway. The walls were bare rock with a very thick plastic sheeting on top of them. Overhead there were fluorescent lighting fixtures and white tiles. The floor was made of textured concrete. The whole place had a very unfinished look about it.</p>
<p>As we took our first steps down the corridor, Karen said, “Kyle, right now you’re walking underneath the most advanced detection array ever built.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Ah. That’s really neat,” I said. I looked at the ceiling, stupidly, knowing that there were probably several feet of rock between us and it.</p>
<p>When we got to the end of the hall, Chen opened a heavy door. Karen went through first, and I motioned for Chen to take his turn, but he insisted on holding the door open for me as well. I’ve always been bothered by this sort of display. I find it emasculating. I’m not sure if that’s a justifiable emotion or just some sort of personal quirk. Either way, I was sure Chen only had the best of intentions, so I shrugged it off.</p>
<p>Once inside, I was pleased to discover a rather nicer room than I’d been expecting. There were some comfortable chairs, a wall of fantastic computer equipment, and some very tasteful incandescent lamps. The room actually had a cozy feeling about it, which was diminished somewhat by the faint odor of ozone. I noted with unexpected relief that there was a restroom down here, though I couldn’t imagine how the plumbing might work.</p>
<p>Aside from me and my companions, the room was vacant. I wondered how often people actually came down here, and how much work was handled remotely in the building far above us. Chen sat down at computer terminal and pulled a tall, desk-mounted microphone near to his face. Into it, he said, “Abe, send me some coordinates.”</p>
<p>A message popped up on Chen’s screen, and he copied its contents onto a notepad, which he then handed to Karen. She nodded and made herself busy doing something technical that I could only guess had something to do with aiming the sensor array they’d been speaking about.</p>
<p>Chen pulled me over to a monitor in the corner of the room. “We need this computer up and running,” he said. “It crapped out on us three days ago. I think there’s a problem with one of the hard drives. It’s a RAID array, just like we had at the hospital. I set it up exactly the way you showed me back in the day, so this should all look familiar to you. I’m a little out of my depth. I’ve been trying to fix it all week, but... well, now things are a little more urgent.”</p>
<p>From somewhere behind me, Karen snorted and said, “He has a gift for understatement, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement, and made a sound that was little more than a grunt. Then I leaned forward and let my hands hover above the keyboard, trying to remember how to begin tackling a disk drive failure.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that I didn’t have physical access to the server hardware. Chen had set me up in front of a monitor and keyboard that were connected to an outlet in the wall. I wondered where the server itself was, and if Chen was foolish enough to bring me down here if the server lived up top in the main building somewhere.</p>
<p>I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. I had never formally been trained in system administration, but over the years I’d been drafted into doing small repairs here and there because I had been one of the few people in my workplace that wasn’t afraid to open a computer case, or play around with the administrative options on my desktop.</p>
<p>My hospital hadn’t been interested in hiring a dedicated tech support person for my department, and our equipment was so specialized that when the hospital-wide tech people showed up to help, they were often even more clueless than we were. In the end I always just wound up spending a few hours googling whatever problem we had, and inevitably found the answers I needed on one online forum or another.</p>
<p>I started interrogating Chen about what exactly he needed in order to be able to run whatever programs were required just now, and where those programs were located in the system. He walked me through everything in a rushed, slightly manic manner, which was not entirely helpful. But in the end, I had learned enough to get started with a moderate level of confidence.</p>
<p>It turned out that this machine was primarily responsible for advanced data analysis. The data gathering and equipment controls were all being handled on separate computers, which were apparently in working order. That explained why PILT had taken their time in solving the problem; no data was being lost or going uncollected--they were just accumulating a backlog of unanalyzed information. But now there was something in heavens that they very much wanted to analyze.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear that Chen had been wrong in believing that the hard drives were the problem. In a RAID array, several hard drives work together, so that if any one of the physical drives break down, the data on the remaining drives can be used to restore whatever was lost. Things only started getting tricky when two or more drives in the array died simultaneously. I had feared that I was going to encounter such a failure.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as it turned out, the actual problem was much more manageable. There was an error message associated with the RAID array which is what had led Chen down that path, but poking around I found that what was truly gumming up the works was nothing so insidious.</p>
<p>“You’ve got something weird going on with one of your file system partitions,” I told Chen.</p>
<p>“I set them up using them same manual you drew up for the hospital computers,” he said, a bit defensively.</p>
<p>I nodded. “Well, you’re not running the same software here as you were there. Anyway, you’ve got a program that’s completely filled up a small partition here, and it’s giving you a bunch of errors when it tries to save new files inside it.”</p>
<p>Karen walked over and asked, “Can you fix it? How long will it take?”</p>
<p>“Well, I can move some of these older files to a different partition--you’ve got plenty of space on the drive. I think that’ll get you up and running... until the partition fills up again. At best it’s a temporary solution.”</p>
<p>“And at worst?” asked Karen.</p>
<p>“At worst I’ll accidentally be moving something critical and your analysis will be all screwy... or maybe I’m entirely on the wrong track and this won’t fix anything. I just don’t know enough about how your software works and how your data is stored.”</p>
<p>“So, how long?” she asked again.</p>
<p>“Uh, maybe 3 minutes,” I said, pleased to see the look of relief on her face.</p>
<p>“And you can undo it if it makes things worse?” asked Chen.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m just moving some files around. Nothing major.” I said.</p>
<p>“See?” Chen said to Karen, “My boy is a genius.”</p>
<p>I found Chen’s praise to be a bit excessive. It hadn’t taken a high degree of skill to discover the problem, just a little more experience than Chen had brought to the task. Still, I wasn’t about to argue the point.</p>
<p>I cleared some space in the partition and let Chen take over the terminal. He declared victory after a moment when his analysis program popped on the screen. We’d made it past the point in his procedure where the error messages had appeared before. Satisfied that we had the situation under control, Karen went back to work at her station. Nothing on her monitor made even the slightest bit of sense to me.</p>
<p>Chen set his analysis program to “Active Streaming Mode” (whatever that was), and got up and went to a coat rack in the corner. He reached for something that at first glance I had thought was a lab coat. When he stepped into it, though, I realized it was some sort of full-body suit.</p>
<p>Chen saw my confusion and said, “Static suit. So I don’t damage the equipment.”</p>
<p>I nodded, and silently wondered exactly what equipment he was talking about.</p>
<p>Chen opened a door in the opposite corner of the room. It revealed a spiral staircase, which Chen ascended as the door closed behind him. Even still, I heard his heavy footsteps as he climbed.</p>
<p>Moments later I noticed a monitor which at first glance I had thought was an inset lighting fixture. It had been displaying an image of pure white, until suddenly it showed a small door opening. It took my brain a moment to understand that I was looking at a camera feed of an entirely nondescript white room--a room which Chen was now entering, with a long tether trailing behind him and out the door. It was a moment after that, that I realized I was looking at the heart of the PILT Observatory, one of the most advanced pieces of technology ever created.</p>
<p>I turned to Karen and said, “Hey, wait a minute. How on Earth are we going to detect an object in space? Is that thing emitting cosmic rays? Aren’t those the only things able to penetrate this deep? Isn’t that the whole point of being this far underground?”</p>
<p>Karen looked at me with amusement and surprise. “You mean Aaron didn’t tell you?”</p>
<p>That was the second time she’d said ‘Aaron’. It finally clicked that she was talking about Chen. How the hell had I forgotten his first name so completely? I shook my head at her, “Didn’t tell me what?”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I’ll tell you if you swear to sign a nondisclosure agreement before you leave.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell from her expression whether or not she was joking. “Yeah, no problem,” I said.</p>
<p>Karen stepped over to me by the monitor and pointed at a strange square-shaped device which Chen was adjusting somehow. “You see that?” she said. “That is the first deep space quantum detection telescope.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” I said. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that.”</p>
<p>“Good,” she said. She didn’t seem interested in explaining it. She went back to her terminal.</p>
<p>“But wait,” I said, “what does it do? How does it work?”</p>
<p>She smiled coyly and said, “You’re going to see the ‘what’ in just a few minutes. The ‘how’ would take longer to explain.”</p>
<p>I watched Chen work for another few minutes before he came back down and shed his static suit. He sat down at the workstation and brought up a rather bare-bones looking controller application. I saw him punch in the coordinates that he’d been sent, and then a status bar appeared, indicating that something was charging.</p>
<p>In a moment, a green button labeled “detect series” appeared in the corner of the application. He looked at Karen and said, “We are ready.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “I’m not,” and she continued her mysterious work.</p>
<p>I looked at Chen questioningly. He said, “I just change the array filter to look for nearby cold objects instead of distant stars. She is calibrating it to look at a closer distance.”</p>
<p>“You mean, she’s focusing it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Chen, flatly, “That would be a simpler way to say that.”</p>
<p>“She’s done,” said Karen.</p>
<p>“Fire one,” said Chen, and he clicked the green button.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. No sound, no flash, nothing- I looked at Chen for an explanation. He just said, “Give it a minute.”</p>
<p>So we waited and eventually something did appear on the screen. It was a series of images lined up like an array of tiny slides. Chen clicked on one to enlarge it. I didn’t see anything but a giant black square with some freckles of light here and there. I was disappointed.</p>
<p>Chen and Karen looked through some of the other slides and then Chen said, “Okay, that was a dud.”</p>
<p>He picked up a phone and dialed. On the other end I heard a muffled voice speak a muffled greeting. Chen, with his old familiar charm said, “You are an idiot.”</p>
<p>Then Chen laughed and said, “But seriously though, those coordinates didn’t work.”</p>
<p>The voice on the line said something I couldn’t make out, and Chen said, “Okay, bye.”</p>
<p>After hanging up, Chen explained that the object had changed course yet again, but that there was now a live coordinate feed coming from some radio telescope farm in Utah. Then, with surprising technical grace, Chen set up the PILT to track the object directly from the remote feed. He went over and showed Karen how to use the same feed to help focus the sensor array.</p>
<p>I watched through the narrow window as unseen motors swivelled the detection array slightly. The motion was smooth and silent and, I imagined, precisely executed down to some obscene fraction of a millimeter.</p>
<p>After all was set, Chen clicked the ‘Detect Series’ button again. This time the array picked up something amazing.</p>
<p>Chen selected one of the slides and it enlarged to breathtaking detail. It was a sharp, arrowhead-shaped object. Its surface had fine indented grooves on it, which reminded me of the types of patterns you can see on an integrated circuit board.</p>
<p>“This is the space object?” I said.</p>
<p>Chen nodded.</p>
<p>We all stood in silence for a few minutes as Chen flipped through the image slides and settled on the best one. Then we all stared in wonder.</p>
<p>“This is a spaceship, right?” Karen asked no one in particular.</p>
<p>I let my mouth hang open for a while before I said, “I uh-- I mean, what else could it be?”</p>
<p>Chen just said, “No way. NO WAY. This is crazy.”</p>
<p>“How big is this?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Chen clicked a button and a grid overlaid the image. I didn’t see any scale associated with the grid, but Chen had all the information he needed.”Almost 900 meters long," he said. “Somewhere around 500 meters wide at the fat part.”</p>
<p>Karen pointed to some numbers in the corner of Chen’s screen and said, “Wow… this thing is closer than it should be. Can we see its trajectory?”</p>
<p>Chen looked at her blankly, and said, “What do you think this is? Star Trek? I have a computer that does one thing<strong>:</strong> it aims an array. Next you’ll be asking me to raise shields and fire at it.”</p>
<p>Karen looked at him coldly, but he broke her indignation with his charismatic laugh.</p>
<p>I said, “Well, if you’ve got a high speed internet connection down here, we could probably get some streaming live news in here. Someone must have a graphic up by now showing us where that thing is headed.”</p>
<p>Chen pulled up a browser and in moments had CNN video displayed on the screen, but with no sound. He played around with the volume controls for a moment, but nothing happened. “I don’t think we get sound on these,” he said.</p>
<p>I thought that that was a silly conclusion, but I didn’t want to bet my newly acquired reputation as a computer wizard on trying to fix it. Instead I suggested that we stick to text news feeds, which would probably be more reliable anyway. So we huddled around Chen’s work station and read the headlines as they came in. The scene reminded me of an old World War II movie--something about people huddled in a bunker waiting for news of air raids to come in, one terse message at a time.</p>
<h3 id="part-i-kyle-chapter-3---quiet">Part I: Kyle / Chapter 3 - Quiet</h3>
<p>We got our news from AP and Reuters releases. At first glance we were bombarded by hundreds of headlines about a UFO coming towards Earth. There was speculation about a secret Chinese space project. There were extremely blurry versions of the images we’d seen clearly on our screen moment’s ago. I started to get a sense for how amazing this PILT detector really was.</p>
<p>“We should send these out to someone,” said Chen, referring back to his slides. Karen agreed, and they emailed a bunch to someone she knew at NASA. She cc’ed almost everyone in the PILT research center above us.</p>
<p>Within minutes Chen was receiving replies in his inbox. People were amazed by the images. Speculation ran rampant. Had we just witnessed the first clear images ever taken of a verifiable alien spacecraft? It was ridiculous, but I couldn’t think of any other explanation. That arrowhead object couldn’t have been a product of nature, could it?</p>
<p>I thought momentarily of the elegant patterns of snowflakes, and wondered if we were looking at some sort of crystal structure that formed in space. But even if such a thing were possible, it didn’t explain the object’s change in course and velocity. How could it be anything but a spacecraft?</p>
<p>I’d been a science fiction fan all my life, and I’d always found the idea of aliens and spaceships interesting and exciting. But I was also an incurable skeptic, and I’d convinced myself that alien visitors in my lifetime was so improbable that it was practically pure fantasy. I wanted to believe it was happening, but I needed to exhaust every other possibility first. Even having personally helped to take pictures of the object was not enough. Things like this just don’t happen.</p>
<p>CNN was showing a graphic depicting a triangle and a circle around the Earth- it was clear they were trying to show an orbital pattern. I said, “I wish we had sound. Do you think they’re actually getting data to suggest it’s going to orbit when it gets here, or is this pure speculation?”</p>
<p>Karen and Chen just shrugged. We all had questions and no answers. Chen hit the refresh button in his news feed, and searched for the word ‘orbit’. We were bombarded by 15 variations on the proclamation: “ALIENS ORBIT THE EARTH!”</p>
<p>Chen said, “Didn’t they say it was hours away?”</p>
<p>I nodded, “I thought I heard that as well.”</p>
<p>Karen said, “Yes I’m certain they said three hours right before we came down here, but by the time we snapped that series it was already deviating from the the predictions”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and they also said it was slowing down, right?” I added.</p>
<p>“How far away were they when you snapped your pictures?” I asked.</p>
<p>They had been aiming their sensor array automatically from a streaming coordinate feed, so Chen had to look at the data associated with his series of slides before he could answer. “Uh, give me a second,” he said. “I’m going to have to do a little math.”</p>
<p>And then, everything went dark.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” I said.</p>
<p>In the blackness, Chen’s voice said, “Relax.”</p>
<p>As the words were leaving his lips I heard a loud click from another room and then a humming sound. The lights came back on. Soon after, the computer monitors clicked to life as well. I was surprised to see that though the monitors had lost power, someone had had the sense to keep the computers themselves hooked up to uninterruptable power supplies. As the screens glowed back to life, everything was exactly as it had been.</p>
<p>Something about the ambient lighting had changed, and without really being able to put my finger on what it, I was certain that all our electricity was now coming from a backup generator.</p>
<p>Karen confirmed this thought a moment later when she said, “We should leave. The generator will be enough to get us back up in the lift.”</p>
<p>She looked uneasy, and suddenly it dawned on me that she had been acting nervous ever since we left the surface. Her technical chat with Chen on ride down had had an unnaturally hyper quality about it, which I had initially attributed to the very exciting and unique circumstances of the evening. She had been all business when we finally arrived down here, but in retrospect there had been subtle cues in her body language that she was just plain uncomfortable being confined in this deep cave. She had hidden her discomfort well, playing the tough professional. But that cool exterior cracked momentarily when she betrayed some relief in having an excuse to leave the place.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I was just projecting my own anxieties. This cave was cosy, only so long as I didn’t let myself think about the millions or billions of tons of rock that were over my head. Still, it seemed rash to flee at the first signs of a power outage when there was so much more work we could be doing down here.</p>
<p>Chen looked towards the lift skeptically and said, “I’m going to call upstairs just so they know to come get us if we’re not back in an hour.”</p>
<p>“I like that idea,” I said.</p>
<p>Karen nodded, and Chen picked up the phone. He pressed some buttons and then replaced the receiver. “No dial tone,” he said. He tried the desk-mounted mic as well, but got no response there either.</p>
<p>Chen typed out an email to someone upstairs, but he got a ‘timeout’ error when he tried to send it. Without thinking, I pulled out my cell phone. Before I could realize how futile that was; they were already shaking their heads at me with mildly disappointed expressions. I powered down the phone, wishing to save what little battery life I had for my drive home.</p>
<p>Karen said, “They already know we’re down here. I think we should head on up. They’ll figure it out if we don’t show up in an hour or so anyway. The worst thing we can do is wait for the generator to die, then we might really be in trouble.”</p>
<p>I didn’t really follow her logic, but frankly I was getting a little claustrophobic. I also wanted to be up there with the rest of humanity if today was going to be the big day when we finally meet an alien species.</p>
<p>We walked to the lift. Once inside, Karen pressed a button on a the control panel. The lift doors closed, but nothing happened. Karen pressed the button again. We stood under the small elevator lights, beneath a pillar of dark, empty shaft. I took a slow breath, trying to stave off the early signs of a panic attack.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Karen, “This isn’t going to do at all.”</p>
<p>She pressed the DOOR OPEN button, to my relief, the doors obeyed. We stepped into the corridor and made our way back to the cozy underground room. This time the unfinished look of the structure didn’t strike me as interesting so much as troubling.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>We briefly discussed taking another series of images of the object, but we quickly discovered that the coordinate feed that Chen had been using was cut off along with all other internet communication.</p>
<p>Karen told Chen to shut down the detector array in order to conserve power. Chen didn’t seem happy about it at all. Apparently there was a considerable amount of work involved in “cold-starting” the array later, which Chen wanted desperately to avoid. He explained that turning the array off completely would put them out of commission for the better part of a day, even if they switched it back on immediately.</p>
<p>This argument swayed Karen, and she agreed to let Chen keep the array on for a while longer. No doubt she’d want to get more pictures of whatever was up there as soon as possible when power was restored. From the way they were talking, I got the impression that neither of them knew how long the backup generator would keep things running.</p>
<p>I sat down in one of the comfy chairs and waited for my hosts to plot our next move. They discussed various options for about half an hour. Nothing fruitful came of it.</p>
<p>Eventually a long silence ensued. I wasn’t sure if it was an awkward silence or just a defeated one. Either way, I found myself contributing to it, for lack of anything useful to say. Occasionally Chen would pick up the phone and test the intercom system that the desk mic was hooked to, but it looked as though we might be in for a long wait.</p>
<p>I shut my eyes for a moment to process the events of evening, but as soon as my lids were sealed, I felt an overwhelming weariness. I hadn’t slept well the night before, and the exhaustion of the long car trip was catching up with me. Even the excitement of the mysterious space object could not keep me awake in the warm, quiet room.</p>
<h3 id="part-i-kyle-chapter-4---up">Part I: Kyle / Chapter 4 - Up</h3>
<p>I awoke, sometime later, momentarily disoriented by my surroundings. I was surprised to find that I had been sleeping, though I suspected that it hadn’t been for long. I was more surprised to realize that I was not the only one who had dozed.</p>
<p>Karen was curled cutely, eyes closed, in a large chair. I allowed my eyes to drift over her body, almost lecherously, as I would not have dared when she was awake. I studied the curves of her body, which we pleasing enough, though not particularly stunning. Still, I’m a man, and sometimes men are compelled to look. She seemed gentle and there was something slightly feline about her, as shallow breaths made her chest rise and fall almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>Chen cleared his throat, and for a moment I thought he’d caught me ogling his boss. When I turned my head, though, I could see that his back was to us, as he played a game of chess on his smartphone. He paused just long enough to click refresh his computer’s browser. Still no internet.</p>
<p>We were cut off from the news during the what might be the most exciting moments in all of human history. It was infuriating. I allowed myself to stew on that for a while, because it was better to feel frustrated and angry than to feel trapped and claustrophobic.</p>
<p>I walked over and picked up the phone on the desk next to Chen. No dial tone. Chen didn’t even look up.</p>
<p>An idea occurred to me suddenly, and I walked back to the elevator. When the doors slid open for me, I went inside, careful keep a foot wedged in the door. I had no desire to be trapped in the tiny, dark lift by myself.</p>
<p>Beneath the elevator control panel, I found an metal cabinet holding an unmarked booklet and a red emergency phone with no keypad. I felt very proud of myself for a minute as I picked up the handset and I heard it start to ring.</p>
<p>My enthusiasm wore off, however, after three minutes of ringing with no answer. I glanced up at the dark shaft above, where the elevator cables disappeared into nothingness. I hung up the phone and retreated back to my companions.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, breaking our long silence, “I think we’re really and truly stuck down here.”</p>
<p>Chen shook his head. “Take it easy. We lose power down here all the time. One of the nearby substations is old and has problems like every time it rains.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it wasn’t raining.” I said.</p>
<p>Chen just shrugged at that.</p>
<p>“Any news, Aaron?” Karen asked, waking with a yawn.</p>
<p>Chen pushed his chair away from the computer and rotated to face us. “No phone, no internet,” he said, matter-of-factly. I found his detached and calm demeanor rather reassuring. If he wasn’t worried yet, then I wasn’t going to be worried either.</p>
<p>“So, I guess worst case scenario we can take some stairs up or something?” I asked.</p>
<p>Chen squinted in concentration as if trying to remember something. “I don’t think so,” he said. “The elevator is all we’ve got. But don’t worry, no one is going to forget that there a people down here with the best telescope on the planet when there are spaceships in the sky.”</p>
<p>He made a good point, but I found the lack of a secondary exit to be distressing. He hadn’t seemed confident in his answer, though, and I was hoping that Karen would correct him. When it was clear that she didn’t have anything to add, I decided to fill a mounting silence. “If we’re stuck down here for awhile, at least we’ll lose some weight, right? So that’s something.”</p>
<p>Chen looked at me quizzically for a moment and then said, “Oh, are you hungry?”</p>
<p>I said, “A little, I was mostly joking.”</p>
<p>Chen smiled at me and stood up. “Come with me, little friend,” he said.</p>
<p>I should note here that I am not ‘little’ by any reasonable standard, and I’m fairly sure Chen would have used the same phrasing if it were me who had two inches on him. I don’t want you to get the wrong idea about Chen, either. He didn’t mean ‘little friend’ as a put-down either; it was just the sort of friendly ribbing he did without even thinking about it. If you’ve never known anyone like Chen then you might find his manner of speaking to be a bit confusing. I apologize for that, but I am striving for accuracy in this recounting.</p>
<p>Chen opened a door that I thought would have led to the restroom. Instead there was a hallway. Though the restroom lay beyond, there was yet another door off to the side. It was when Chen opened this side door that my spirits were lifted.</p>
<p>The room we stepped into was fairly large. In the corner was the large generator, humming away. Along the walls and on several shelves that jutted into the room, there were boxes of food and jugs of water. They even had a rather impressive medical station including a portable defibrillator.</p>
<p>Chen spotted something in the corner and said, “Oh yeah!”</p>
<p>I watched him stroll over to a large bin and pull out some small bags with drawstrings. He tossed one to me. I caught it and read the label: ‘Ultra-Compact Sleeping Bag’. I had mixed emotions. I was glad for the comfort, but I had not yet resigned myself to spending the rest of the night in this hole in the ground.</p>
<p>Chen must have seen the hesitation in my face. He said, “You’re not on a night schedule like we are, and you’ve had a long drive. Don’t be a hero.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, really,” I lied.</p>
<p>“I saw you passing out in that chair, dude.”</p>
<p>I nodded my resignation.</p>
<p>“Good,” Chen said with a wry smile. “If you sleep, it won’t look so bad if I take a nap.”</p>
<p>Chen handed me a box of food and picked up a large jug of water. We walked back to where Karen was sitting, and Chen handed her a sleeping bag. She smiled and said, “Oh, fantastic!”</p>
<p>I pulled some packaged foods from the box Chen had handed me. It reminded me of the meals I used to bring when I went backpacking in the woods. They ended up tasting about the same as well, and I was grateful for the nourishment.</p>
<p>In spite of the sleeping bags, none of us slept anymore that night. Oh, we tried for a while, but there was far too much running through our heads. Eventually accepted that it was a lost cause, and we talked instead. It felt a bit like camping with old friends.</p>
<p>We shared intimate stories, and speculated about the aliens above. Every so often we would try the phones, and the computers. With no sunlight to cue my circadian rhythms I spent the next several hours in a haze.</p>
<p>We’d been down in the underground lab for quite some time before I really started to worry. I let the elevator phone ring for an hour before hanging it up. The internet and the regular phone system showed no signs of improvement. I started opening some filing cabinets and looking through PILT documents just to keep my mind occupied.</p>
<p>Karen said, “Find anything interesting?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. She said, “Yeah, I’m not surprised, those technical manuals are pretty dry. When we get out of here remember to have me send down some juicy mystery novels.”</p>
<p>I smiled politely, but I was starting to lose my patience. I was angry at the situation, and it was taking a lot of self control to avoid blaming Karen and Chen. They were victims here too, but part of me wanted to strangle them for getting us trapped down here.</p>
<p>“Just to clarify,” I asked, “the lift is the only way out of here?”</p>
<p>Chen nodded, but he wasn’t exuding much confidence. His nonchalant attitude was starting to wear on me a bit. And though he was an undeniably brilliant person, he could also be surprisingly dim about certain things. I began to wonder if maybe there was an emergency exit down here that he’d never bothered to learn about.</p>
<p>I was starting to feel at home down here, and so I didn’t ask permission as I began to explore my surroundings. I opened a narrow door that I had assumed was a closet, and instead found a tiny kitchenette with a microwave, a sink with working hot and cold taps, and a small, understocked refrigerator. I searched through a small set of drawers and found little of interest outside of a nearly empty pack of granola bars.</p>
<p>I walked around the facility slowly, examining every wall for signs of maintenance doors, and looking at the ceiling and floor for anything resembling a hatchway or manhole cover. Other than a few access panels concealing various power and data cables, there was nothing to be found.</p>
<p>I went back to the elevator shaft and took a good look at the walls. There were some metal protrusions off of the support beams which I imagined might be suitable for climbing, but I judged that the vertical ascent would take hours, and would be incredibly dangerous for anyone who wasn’t wearing a safety harness.</p>
<p>I guessed that I would be useless from exhaustion before I even made it halfway to the top. And then what? I’d be trapped in the middle of a pitch-black shaft, unable to even lie down and regain my strength. My muscles would be twitching from over-exertion, and below me would be a deadly fall. No thanks.</p>
<p>I went back to find Chen and Karen. I shared my findings with them, and they seemed unimpressed. Karen did examine the elevator shaft, though. When she came back, she just gave me a sad nod.</p>
<p>We found a deck of cards in one of the storage boxes, and we busied ourselves playing every game we could think of. This went on for hours. Eventually we tired of it and tried to amuse ourselves in other ways. I searched through the computer hard drives for anything interesting and found nothing--not even a game of solitaire.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen busied themselves with yet another game of War when I declined to play go-fish. I wandered back to the storage room where Chen had found the sleeping bags. The boxes of food in here looked as though they could sustain us comfortably for a week or more, and with the running water, we wouldn’t even need to break into the bottled supplies.</p>
<p>The generator chugged happily in the corner. It had a number of gauges displaying things that meant nothing to me. Markedly absent was anything indicating fuel levels. For that matter, I didn’t see any storage tanks around. There were, however, some large pipes connecting the generator to the wall. A small access door was almost hidden around the side of the generator, but it had a high-voltage warning sign on it which was enough to check my curiosity for the moment.</p>
<p>I returned to observation lab where Karen and Chen were sitting with playing cards strewn haphazardly between them. Neither protested as I started looking through their filing cabinets again, pulling out folders. Mostly I found manufacturers manuals for the various pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>From behind me I heard Chen sigh. “This is ridiculous,” he said. “How long does it take to get a damn phone working?”</p>
<p>I turned around. He was still sitting on the floor with Karen, but he was holding a receiver from the desk phone which he’d pulled over to his side. He looked agitated and tired. I suppose we all did.</p>
<p>Karen looked at her watch. “I count thirty-six hours without power. That’s a long blackout.”</p>
<p>“The generator,” I said, “How long?”</p>
<p>“I was told two weeks,” said Karen. But that was at one hundred percent power consumption from the array and everything."</p>
<p>I was contemplating the prospect of a two-week stay down there when I looked down at the file I was absentmindedly flipping through.</p>
<p>“Hey! Look at this!” I shouted. Karen and Chen looked at me curiously as I brought the document over.</p>
<p>“Oh good,” said Chen. But he seemed unimpressed.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, “Look at <em>this</em>.”</p>
<p>I pointed to a table of contents, and a section labeled ‘ELEVATOR FAILURE / MANUAL LIFT CONTROLS’. They stopped playing cards and read with me.</p>
<p>The instructions were complicated, but nothing we couldn’t handle. As it turned out, attached to the side of the lift was a mechanical hand crank. The hand crank needed to be removed from its storage mount, then fastened to the cables after removing a protective panel. It took us about 45 minutes to work out the mechanics of it, but in the end it wasn’t too much harder than changing a car tire.</p>
<p>The crank mechanism wouldn’t move us very fast. Aside from the weight of three adults, it also had to raise the lift itself. It was designed well, though, and required only a moderate amount of strength to operate. The crank handle was very large, and one full rotation would only raise the lift by a few inches. The feel of it reminded me peddling my old 10-speed bike at it’s highest setting.</p>
<p>The emergency manual didn’t give any hints, but we estimated that it would take at least six hours to hand-power the lift to the top of the shaft. We considered how much food and water we should bring- if any. And we decided that a day’s ration of food would do fine, along with plenty of water, which we were sure we would be sweating out.</p>
<p>We all relieved ourselves in the restroom. It had turned out to be a flush toilet, to my great shock. I tried not to think too terribly hard about where all the waste went to- it certainly wasn’t being pump all the way back up… was it?</p>
<p>I took a half-dose of imodium in the hopes that it would keep my bowels out of commission during the long, bathroomless assent to the surface. I had no desire to relieve myself through the metal grate on the floor at any point during our journey. I offered some extra tablets to Chen and Karen, but neither of them shared my concerns.</p>
<p>It had been about forty hours since the blackout began, and by unanimous vote, we decided it was time to make our way to the surface. We tried the phone and the internet one last time before climbing into the elevator and closing the doors behind us. Karen pressed the button marked “UP”. The doors slid shut, but the elevator remained motionless.</p>
<p>The hand-crank mechanism was designed for use by either one or two people, and we opted for the latter option. Karen got the first resting shift because Chen and I thought that was the gentlemanly thing. This elicited an eyeroll from her, but with hours of labor ahead for all of us it wasn’t a major issue.</p>
<p>Our assent was slow- much slower than we had hoped. I noticed depth markers on some of the beams that framed the shaft, and assuming that we were aiming for a depth of ‘0’, I estimated that we would arrive in 8 hours, if we worked constantly. Every 15 minutes we rotated places with one person sitting out, and the other two rotating the crank.</p>
<p>After three hours we found that this pace was unsustainable. We took long breaks, resigned to the idea that it would take us quite some time to complete the journey. Fortunately the cranking mechanism prevented the lift from sliding down the cables, so we were able to rest without keeping pressure on the handle. Still, I kept my hand on it... just in case.</p>
<p>At 6 hours we all took a long break to have a substantial meal, and to rest our aching muscles. At 7 hours we passed the halfway mark. At 11 hours we took a vote and decided to get some real sleep.</p>
<p>I sat in the dim light, looking at the perfect blackness above and below. I was beyond feeling claustrophobic, nor was I any longer bothered by the height. I felt small--incredibly small, like a snowflake falling through a pitch-black sky.</p>
<p>I looked at the shaft supports wondering how long it had taken to construct this amazing shaft. On one of the beams I noticed something that might have be a cockroach. I was about to flick it to its doom, but after a moment’s inspection I realized that it was already dead. I wondered how long it had been stuck there. I didn’t feel much sympathy for it, though. Dirty little things.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen slept. Sleep took me, too, but it was not a peaceful thing. My entire body ached and my mind was uneasy. I dreamed of a telephone ringing at the top of an elevator shaft while a crowd of people stood around and refused to answer it.</p>
<p>I woke to find Chen and Karen busily rotating the handle. It had probably only been a few hours of rest, but I did feel that some of my strength had been replenished. I stood up and stretched as best I could in the confined space, then I relieved Chen. He gave me a grateful nod, and slid down in the corner.</p>
<p>From that point on we abandoned any organized labor sharing. We each took a turn and worked as long as we could. Sometimes two of us rested at once--sometimes all three. The going was slow.</p>
<p>We had reached and passed the ‘0’ marker an hour earlier. The dark shaft was playing games with my head. I was starting to wonder if I was stuck in some real life Twilight Zone where I was eternally trapped, cranking this elevator for all time, like Sisyphus pushing his boulder up a hill.</p>
<p>Karen and I were sharing the work when it happened. In a hypnotic daze we were turning the crank. My eyes were half shut, and I was fantasizing about an amazing king-sized bed I’d enjoyed once at a luxury hotel in Texas. And suddenly--</p>
<p>**-CLANK-**</p>
<p>The elevator shook and the sound reverberated down into the bowels of the shaft. There was a moment of panic and confusion until Chen announced that he saw the top of a door. We had overshot it by a couple of feet. We briefly debated setting the hand crank in reverse and lowering ourselves, but we thought the better of it when Karen suggested that such a maneuver might end up plunging us into a freefall.</p>
<p>The inner lift doors still opened with the press of a button, but the outer doors did not. We cried out for help and banged on the outer doors with our fists and feet. This caused the lift to shake, which we all quickly agreed was a bad thing.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of making the best racket we could, we stopped and listened. We were met by heavy silence. We wailed a bit more, but in the end we all knew that help was not coming.</p>
<p>We pried apart the doors with considerable effort. Because lift was misaligned with the floor, we only had access to the top part of the doors. This left us with very poor leverage and didn’t make the task any easier. Fortunately, Chen was carrying pocket knife which got us the first, most critical, inch of separation. From there we clawed and kicked at the doors until they yielded.</p>
<p>I slid out first, which was terrifying. The lift was about three and a half feet above where it ought to be, so as I slid down, I felt that at any moment I might slip into the shaft below the lift. I was able to find my footing, though, and at last I was on solid ground.</p>
<p>I stepped back from the elevator doors and looked down the dark hallway. I walked a few feet to wall and felt for a lightswitch. I found one, but it did nothing. If the upstairs had a backup generator, it wasn’t working.</p>
<p>I walked back to the lift and helped the others down. Though the only light in the hall was coming from the bulbs inside the lift, we pushed the elevator doors shut for safety’s sake. With the lift misaligned, the open elevator shaft would have been a death trap.</p>
<p>We let our eyes adjust for a moment. One end of the hallway was pitch-black… the other end showed signs of light around a distant corner. I headed towards the light, instinctively, but Chen grabbed my arm.</p>
<p>“This way,” he said, and the three of us marched into the dark.</p>
<p>We rounded a corner and moments later I heard Karen trip on something. Chen asked if she was okay, and she didn’t respond. Chen asked again, and we heard Karen say, “Oh my god.”</p>
<p>Her tone more than her words sent a chill through me. I shouted “What?! What?!”</p>
<p>She fed us a terrifyingly long silence in the darkness.</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” she said, after a moment. “There’s a dead person on the floor right here.”</p>
<p>There was a long pause as we all tried to figure out what to do with this development. I for one had never been near a dead body outside of a couple of closed-casket funerals, and though I couldn’t see the one that Karen had discovered, I had some sense of its proximity, and found it deeply unnerving. Somehow the inability to see the corpse made it worse.</p>
<p>Chen spoke first, in a voice that sounded a little strangled. “Okay, let’s just be calm and get to the exit. I’ll take the lead. Why don’t you hold my hand?”</p>
<p>Chen offering his hand to woman was uncharacteristically chivalrous, and Karen didn’t seem like the type to cling to a man in crisis. But, she offered no argument I and heard the soft sound of their hands clasping together. A moment later I felt Karen grip my hand as well, and she led me carefully around the body.</p>
<p>The three of us stepped farther into the darkness. After some scuffling and cursing sounds, Chen announced the discovery of another body... and then another. In the perfect darkness we did our best to step around them.</p>
<p>I felt my foot fall firmly on what I assume was the thigh of one of the corpses. I lifted it off immediately and nearly lost my balance trying to set it down again. It seemed that wherever I tried to place it, I was landing on another limb of the body. To stop from stumbling, I wound up having to put my weight on what felt like a hand. I heard and felt the sickening snap of a bone under the ball of my foot.</p>
<p>All three of us paused for a minute.</p>
<p>Chen said, “Was that--”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I cut him off.</p>
<p>Karen said, “Let’s keep moving please.”</p>
<p>In the back of my mind a terrible fear was growing. It was more than the dark and the dead bodies. Those were animal fears. Those were the things that were making my heart pound like it was trying to break through my chest. But there was something more; something shapeless on the edge of conscious thought.</p>
<p>Eventually we got to the side exit, and Chen pushed the heavy door open. We were blinded by daylight, which came was a shock to me. I had somehow lost track of the hour, and was expecting to find a night sky. We all stood just outside the doors and gave our eyes time to adjust.</p>
<p>When I could see again, the first thing I noticed were the birds.</p>
<p>There was a dead one in the parking lot, and another a dozen yards away. I saw two on the street. A flock of small black birds were scattered on the ground beneath a tree, resting like fallen fruit.</p>
<p>“Who are they, do you think?” Karen said to Chen.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he replied. “The last one is Mitch, I think. Big guy.”</p>
<p>They were peering into the now partially illuminated hallway, looking at the corpses of their dead colleagues. Karen was looking quite pale. Chen didn’t appear to be as shaken, but then, he was always pretty hard to read.</p>
<p>Karen nodded. “The first one was Marty, or Jeremy I think. He had a beard.”</p>
<p>Nobody spoke for a while. We were all in a bit of shock. I broke the silence with an unhelpful, “What the fuck.”</p>
<p>“What. The. Fuck.” I said again. It wasn’t a question, really.</p>
<p>Karen said, “This is insane.”</p>
<p>Chen let the door close. It gave a loud click as he pulled it firmly, as if he were trying to keep death locked firmly inside. But looking at the birds again, I could see that death was already out here too.</p>
<p>I nudged Karen and nodded at the birds in the parking lot.</p>
<p>“Oh god,” said Karen. “The birds, too!”</p>
<p>I started to say something, but my throat felt tight and dry. I became aware of the sound of my heartbeat pulsating loudly in my ears. Panic and exhaustion were taking their toll. I had to force myself to take several slow, deep breaths before I regained my wits.</p>
<p>If Karen or Chen had noticed my strange freak out, they certainly didn’t let on. I suspect, though, that they were busy dealing with their own internal battles with terror and panic. I doubted that either of them had been around this much death before.</p>
<p>Karen took a few cautious steps into the parking lot. Chen walked around the corner of the building, and I strolled forward aimlessly, transfixed by the number of dead insects I had just discovered on the ground.</p>
<p>“The air smells funny,” said Karen after a time. She said it matter-of-factly, and she seemed rather vacant. I don’t know where her thoughts were, but they weren’t with us.</p>
<p>She was right about the air. It smelled of ozone, and behind that sharpness there was something else a bit off. I’ve never been too attentive to my olfactory senses, so I’m not terribly good at articulating these things. The best way I can describe it is to say that the air was stale somehow. More than that, though, there was a sense of something missing from the air’s usual bouquet.</p>
<p>“So... what do we do?” asked Chen, when he eventually wandered back to us.</p>
<p>“I guess we call somebody,” said Karen. “9-1-1.”</p>
<p>I pulled out my phone and powered it up, grateful that I’d conserved the battery. Chen and did the same with his, but Karen just looked at her phone in disgust and put it back in her pocket.</p>
<p>After a minute, my phone sprang to life. It registered no signal, but I thought it might need a minute to warm up and find a tower. No such luck.</p>
<p>“I’m not getting any bars,” I said. “I’m on Verizon.”</p>
<p>Chen was also unable to get a signal. He was on T-Mobile, so it wasn’t a carrier problem. He also said he usually got moderately good service in the area. We concluded that the nearby antenna towers must be out of commission.</p>
<p>“We could use a landline,” I suggested, nodding at the door that Chen had just closed.</p>
<p>Karen and Chen were both silent for a moment. Neither of them were eager to go back into a dark building full of the corpses of the co-workers. I wasn’t keen on it either, but at least they were strangers to me.</p>
<p>“I’ll go,” I said. “Just keep that door propped open wide.”</p>
<p>Chen generously volunteered to head in with me, so Karen manned the door as I inhaled deeply and went back inside. I can’t say why, I but I felt compelled to hold my breath while I was in there. Sharing the same air shared by the dead people seemed unwise. It wasn’t superstition, exactly--its just that I could almost feel death and disease all around me.</p>
<p>When my lungs finally screamed for air, I found myself taking shallow breaths through clenched teeth. Chen and I had ducked into the first office in the hall and he held the door open while I made for the phone on the desk. It was a typical office phone with many buttons and LEDs, but not a single one was lit. The was no dial tone. I pressed all the buttons but didn’t hear so much as a click on the line.</p>
<p>“It’s dead,” I said.</p>
<p>That was enough for Chen, who clearly wanted to vacate the building as soon as possible. We dashed out to the parking lot again, informing Karen of the situation as we we escaped once more into the bright sunlight.</p>
<p>“Okay then,” she said. “We just drive into town and find a police station or a fire station or something.”</p>
<p>It seemed like the next logical thing to do, so without another word we followed Karen to her car. She stopped a few feet short when she realized her keys were in her office. None of us were keen on the idea of going back inside again, so we walked to my car instead.</p>
<p>I fished the keys out of my pocket, but the car wouldn’t respond to my remote. I put the key in the door and opened it. I tried to unlock the other doors but the button didn’t work. It seemed like the battery was dead. I put the key in the ignition and turned it. There was a clicking noise but the</p>
<p>engine wouldn’t turn over. Oddly the lights worked fine.</p>
<p>“It’s not the battery, but something is wrong with it,” I said apologetically.</p>
<p>It was damned peculiar, and I suppose that even back then I must have suspected that it was related to all the death and the blackout. Karen and Chen must have suspect that as well, but I don’t think any of us said it aloud. Car troubles were low on the list of worrisome phenomena.</p>
<p>We tried Chen’s truck next. It was a rusty old pickup with an ugly blue tarp bunched up in the back. It badly needed a paint job, but the tires looked brand new. Chen had had this truck since high school, and he loved it dearly. He climbed into the driver’s side, and we heard the engine turn over without so much as a cough.</p>
<p>Karen and I squeezed into the cab, and Chen took off down the road. As we started towards the nearest town center, I spotted more dead birds and also several dead squirrels. Then we started to see the car accidents.</p>
<p>It started with an SUV spun off into a ditch. We investigated and found the driver quite dead, slumped over as if he’d had a heart attack. We hadn’t inspected the bodies back at the Observatory, but from the brief glances I’d gotten, I’d say they looked about the same. The bodies were unmolested. No visible wounds. No puddles of blood.</p>
<p>We drove past two more car wrecks, stopping at both, and finding no survivors. A few miles down the road, we saw an entire field full of dead birds. There must have been hundreds of them. I looked into the sky. I didn’t see anything but the clear blue and a few scattered clouds. “Stop the car,” I said.</p>
<p>Chen stopped the car, and then on request, the engine. I stepped outside and shut my eyes. Karen and Chen followed me. “What is it?” Karen asked.</p>
<p>“Shhh…” I said, “Listen.”</p>
<p>They were quiet. I was quiet. We heard not a bird, not a cricket, nor an airplane or a car; just the wind in the leaves and the sound of our own breathing.</p>
<p>After a minute of silence, Chen asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p>I waited a minute more, straining my ears for the faint sound of anything at all. I looked at Karen, who must have seen a question in my eyes. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I said to Chen. “Absolutely nothing.”</p>
<p>We gave him a moment to appreciate the weight of the silence. When understanding finally dawned on him, we got back into the car. He started the engine and we continued the slow drive into town.</p>
<h3 id="part-i-kyle-chapter-5---still">Part I: Kyle / Chapter 5 - Still</h3>
<p>I can’t remember the name of the town. You probably wouldn’t remember it either, had you ever been there. I’d driven through towns like this a hundred times. It was the sort of town made for passing through.</p>
<p>There was a McDonald’s, a Taco Bell, a Shell station catty-corner to an Exxon station, a Starbucks, a Dunkin Donuts, and so on; a grab-bag selection of the most popular chain stores and restaurants the great US of A had on offer.</p>
<p>Being in a place like this always made me suspect that there might be some draw just out of sight, off of the main road. Maybe it was a town that built up around a mineral mine, or perhaps there was fertile farmland aplenty for miles around. Maybe the CIA or the NSA has a major headquarters there operating out of an industrial park, hidden in a building with an innocuous name like “Carter-MacDougal Technologies”. The alternative was just too depressing to accept. It cannot possibly be that the country was littered with towns that have absolutely no identities of their own, filled with people who worked at one of these generic stores just to spend money at another next door.</p>
<p>As we pulled into Anytown, our conversation ceased. We’d seen many dead animals and car wrecks along the way, but we’d all hoped to see some sign of life closer to the town center. Instead, we found a terrible stillness.</p>
<p>Dead bodies were lying about, limp and peaceful. A few cars were scattered unusually, resting against lamp posts and puncturing storefronts. The traffic lights and shop signs were dark, though the headlights of a couple of the cars were still shining.</p>
<p>We pulled into a gas station where an old man was lying in a heap against his car. The automobile was a classic--a relic of the 50s I guessed, which made it slightly younger than its presumed owner. The lights were on, and they beaconed to Chen. He pulled nose-to-nose with it.</p>
<p>We got out, but left the car running. The engine and our footfalls were the only sound to be heard. The ambient smell of gasoline was familiar and welcome. This was the first place we’d encountered that smelled exactly like it ought to.</p>
<p>Karen inspected the old man’s body. Tentatively, almost reverently, she turned him over. His eyes were open and vacant. Karen let her long fingers touch his neck for a moment, as if to check a pulse. It seemed futile, but I admit that I was still naive enough to be a little hopeful.</p>
<p>Karen frowned and removed her hand after only the briefest of moments. “He’s cold,” she said.</p>
<p>“Any idea how he died?” asked Chen.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t even begin to guess,” she said, frowning. Then she took a deep breath and steeled herself, and leaned over the corpse, giving a stern and penetrating look.</p>
<p>She began to manipulate the old man’s limbs, ears and eyes. She looked determined and dispassionate. She probably didn’t have any idea what she was looking for, but I respected the hell out of her for the effort.</p>
<p>I was feeling a bit queasy watching Karen work. I had never given it any real thought, but now confronted with the situation, I realized that touching and manipulating a corpse was very low on the list of things I would be willing to do in any circumstance. Karen looked only mildly uncomfortable, though, like a veteran parent changing a dirty diaper.</p>
<p>She began inspecting the man’s mouth, crossing some unexpected and mysterious threshold of vicarious ickiness. I was compelled to intercede. I spoke loudly, almost yelling, “Shouldn’t you ... uh... wouldn’t you like wear some gloves, or something?”</p>
<p>Karen looked up at me and then back down at the corpse. Then she looked critically at her hands. She gave the briefest of nods and scrunched her face in a look of mild disgust--the faintest echo of what I was experiencing on her behalf.</p>
<p>“There’s some hand sanitizer over there,” I pointed to the dispenser that was mounted inside the gas station attendant’s booth. I felt a growing compulsion to use the stuff myself.</p>
<p>I felt some of the tension leave me as Karen applied a very liberal amount sanitizing gel to her hands, wrists and forearms. Evidently my disgust was contagious, because she made no attempt to find gloves or in any way resume her examination of the corpse. Instead she just gave us a shrug, confirming that she wasn’t going to see anything in the corpse that we hadn’t figured out already.</p>
<p>I wandered slowly over to the gas station’s main entrance. Inside was a small convenience store, just barely illuminated by the now waning sunlight. In places like this, one could always find soda, junk food, beef jerky, cigarettes, bad hot dogs, burnt coffee, and a general air of sadness.</p>
<p>Finding the door unlocked, I pulled it open a bit and leaned in. The air was warm, thick and still. The faint smell of cooked meat wafted from somewhere in the depths. It was not entirely unpleasant, and I tried to remember how long it had been since I’d eaten.</p>
<p>“Hello?” I asked softly.</p>
<p>I got no reply, so called out loudly, “Hello? Uh- anybody in here?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t expected to find anyone, but the silence that met me was so heavy that I felt like a doomed character in a horror movie. Brushing these childish thoughts away, I peered in at the store’s wares. Spying nothing enticing, and feeling very uneasy, I explored no further.</p>
<p>When I returned to my comrades, they were still standing uncomfortably close to the dead body. Chen had taken a flip-phone from the man’s pocket, but it seemed to be just as dead as its owner. Karen was wearing a contemplative expression as she flicked the car’s headlights off and on, and played with the knobs of the car’s dead radio.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said to Karen, “Do you want to honk the horn and see if anyone in this town is awake?”</p>
<p>Note that I said ‘awake’ and not ‘alive’. For me, this passes for optimism.</p>
<p>Karen nodded and leaned on the horn for about a ten count. The sharp sound filled the town, and compelled me to squeeze my hands over my ears. When Karen finally released it, we heard the horn’s echo as it bounced off of distant hills. Nothing inside of two miles with a working eardrum could have missed it.</p>
<p>We waited several minutes for something to stir, or a for a voice to call out to us. When neither happened, Karen leaned on the horn again, briefly. We waited a while longer, but no one came or cried out. No distant horn echoed a reply. For now, we were alone.</p>
<p>We all exchanged solemn glances. Our feelings of hopelessness, fear and despair were being kept in check, but in this exchange we were auditing each other for cracks.. The scope of our problem was beginning to suggest itself, and for the foreseeable future, we were in it together.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Chen. “Plan time.”</p>
<p>We all looked at each other expectantly, but it was clear that none of us had been prepared to find an entire town dead. We’d come here for answers. So much for that.</p>
<p>“Well, I for one would like to get the hell out of here,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m kind of feeling that, too,” said Karen.</p>
<p>“Alright,” said Chen, “Where to?”</p>
<p>“I live about twenty minutes north of here,” said Karen, softly.</p>
<p>“That close?” asked Chen.</p>
<p>Karen nodded. A look of fresh concern darkened her face.</p>
<p>We didn’t know what had killed everyone at PILT and here in town. The obvious culprit was the object we’d been tracking in space. But what wasn’t clear was the mechanism at work. How did it kill? And more importantly, how far out did the destruction extend? I thought about the car horn echoing in distant hills a moment ago.</p>
<p>“What about you, Chen?” I asked. “How close?”</p>
<p>Chen shook his head and said, “Don’t worry about me. I live alone.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t understood until just that moment that I ought to have been worried about Chen and certainly about Karen. I was a bachelor, living alone. Who did these two have waiting at home for them?</p>
<p>One look at Karen was enough. I didn’t even have to ask the question. She looked a little sick, and Chen gave her a firm squeeze on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he’s fine,” Chen said, but it sounded hollow to me, and probably more so to her.</p>
<p>I wondered who the ‘he’ was--a boyfriend? A husband? Karen wasn’t wearing a ring. I prayed that they weren’t talking about a son. I wanted to ask, but the moment to do so tactfully was gone too soon. We just got in the car, and Karen fed Chen some terse directions. An awful silence had descended on us.</p>
<p>The drive to Karen’s house was increasingly terrible. As we pulled away from town we saw fewer and few car accidents, and for a while we thought that we might be leaving the death behind us. But then we realized we weren’t seeing any signs of life, either. No birds in the sky, or squirrels on power lines. No cars coming from the opposite direction. Not even a cricket chirping.</p>
<p>Near to Karen’s house we saw a car in a ditch. It had driven right off the road when the driver had died--just like all the rest. The great suffocating stillness was here. There could be no doubt.</p>
<p>Karen let out an audible sob. I turned my attention from the window to look at her. Her eyes were swollen with tears, but she was trying to hold some semblance of composure.</p>
<p>Minutes later we pulled into her driveway, the crunch of gravel under the tires was the loudest sound we’d heard in some time. Karen lived in a attractive duplex, and a cold, detached part of my brain couldn’t help but try to calculate what sort of rent she must have been paying. Before I could really even take it in, though, Karen bolted from the car, running up to the house.</p>
<p>Chen looked at me uncertainly and said, “...should we?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. And at that, we both exited the vehicle and followed Karen at a jog.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask Chen exactly whose corpse we were about to find inside, but in the total quiet of the dusk, I knew the words would find their way to Karen. I held my tongue. Soon I would know, and I would be in the presence of her awful grief.</p>
<p>Karen was at the door fumbling her key into the lock. As soon as the latch clicked, she turned to us and said, quietly, “Can you give me a minute, please?”</p>
<p>We nodded silently. I imagined that if I were in Karen’s place, I’d want company. I suspected that she was a braver and stronger person than I was.</p>
<p>Chen and I stood outside the threshold, awkwardly. We waited in silence, bracing ourselves to hear Karen give a shout of horror at any moment. There was none.</p>
<p>After a minute, Chen shouted nervously into the house, “Do you need any--uh--help?”</p>
<p>There was no reply, but moments later we heard footsteps from inside; Karen descending a set of stairs. She was sobbing deeply. In her arms was blanket wrapped around a small body. So, it was a child after all. I felt my guts twist in knots. I averted my eyes before the nightmarish reality of it could consume me.</p>
<p>“He was on the floor,” Karen said, between choked breaths. “He’s so cold.”</p>
<p>Karen was walking towards us, and for a moment I felt an irrational panic at the thought that she might be intending to pass the body over to me and Chen. It was as though I was afraid that her grief was contagious, and that she was about to spread it to me. Almost immediately I chided myself for being a self-absorbed coward.</p>
<p>When Karen was just a few feet away, it was clear that she intended to hold tight to the bundle, and walk it outside. Chen and I stepped aside to give her a wide berth. As she passed I felt something soft and furry brush against my arm. It took a moment for the sensation to register in my brain. When it did, I a quickly caught up to Karen to get a better look at the bundle in her arms.</p>
<p>“That’s a dog!” I yelled, accusatively.</p>
<p>Karen half-turned towards me in confusion. I could see it clearly now: a little white paw hanging out from the blanket. At the other end, the head was wrapped, but it was clearly canine-shaped.</p>
<p>Karen just let out another big sob. “Yes,” she said.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” I said, putting my hands to my temples, “I thought it was your baby!”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a baby,” Karen said, confused.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I guess I just figured that out,” I said, exasperation fading to embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said with a sniff.</p>
<p>Chen was staring at me with wide eyes and an expression that I couldn’t quite read.</p>
<p>There was very long and strange moment between us before Karen resumed walking. Her sobbing had diminished significantly, and I guessed that I had inadvertently given her some perspective on her grief. When she got to the car, she paused for a spell, then trekked back a ways.</p>
<p>“I guess I should leave him here,” she said.</p>
<p>No one said anything for about ten seconds, then Chen volunteered, “We could help you bury him.”</p>
<p>Karen considered this. “No,” she said. “I’m being silly. We’ve got bigger problems to deal with. right now.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said, trying to make amends for my earlier outburst, “We’d be happy to help.”</p>
<p>Karen looked uncertain, but she acquiesced. In the end it only took about ten minutes to get the dog sufficiently covered in a mound of dirt and stones. After that, Karen said a few words that basically boiled down to: ‘Fluffy, I love you’. Except that wasn’t really the dog’s name. I can’t remember the dog’s name.</p>
<h3 id="part-i-kyle-chapter-5.5---survivors">Part I: Kyle / Chapter 5.5 - Survivors</h3>
<p>The definitive moment for us was driving into New York City. Like all the other places we’d been, it was utterly lifeless. But unlike the suburbs and remote towns, the city was iconic--symbolic, even. If you can’t make it here, you can’t make it anywhere.</p>
<p>It was here that we finally understood the horrible truth. Everyone everywhere was dead. We would travel far and wide to confirm it--there was no way around that. But here in the biggest ghost town on Earth, we knew we were at the end of the world.</p>
<p>We drove where we could. There were many bodies in the road and cars littered the streets and sidewalks. We eventually made our way to Times Square. This was the heart of the city. The center of the world, perhaps.</p>
<p>We stepped out of the car and spent several minutes participating in the grimmest sort of sightseeing. No more perfect picture of armageddon ever was. There must have been an impromptu gathering here. The entire city had poured onto the street to watch news together. And now, an ocean of corpses surrounded us--fathers, mothers, sons and daughters.</p>
<p>It was in this moment that I realized that my family and friends must be dead. There was always hope, of course, and that wouldn’t be extinguished until I’d seen their bodies for myself. I would not mourn until then. But I knew. I <em>knew</em>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just that the corpses; it was the utter, smothering silence in the air. There was no sound of traffic, or airplanes, of birds or crickets. We’d tried every radio we could find. Most wouldn’t make a sound. The oldest ones gave us the quiet hiss of static.</p>
<p>After a long while we walked back in the car. By silent agreement, none of us spoke until Chen was driving us across the George Washington Bridge. When at last we were on the other side, Karen answered our unasked question.</p>
<p>“California,” she said.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We were about seven hundred miles from the west coast and we’d seen no signs of life on our journey. It hadn’t been a straight shot to California. We all agreed that that’s where we needed to go, to confirm the geographic boundaries (if boundaries there be) of this blanket of death.</p>
<p>The first stop on the way out west had been my parent’s house because they had been the closest to the city. I will not recount in detail how I found them. I believe it would bring me great pain to revisit those memories even now.</p>
<p>I will note that the numbness and dispassion which had built up like calluses on my nerves did nothing to ease the shock seeing them dead. It’s not the same when it’s your own kin.</p>
<p>My parents had once mentioned that they wanted to be cremated, and I briefly considered burning down the house around them. Karen had speculated that this might trigger a massive fire that would spread without any foreseeable end, and that it might end up killing some other survivors somewhere out there.</p>
<p>In the end, I kissed each of them--in this low moment welcoming death, if it be on their skin--and said my goodbyes. We buried them in shallow graves. I said some brief words over them and about them.</p>
<p>At least they died together. They would not have to mourn for one another, or for the Earth. That was for me, and for Karen, and Chen.</p>
<p>We buried other people that day, and the next and the next: Chen’s mother, and his girlfriend, one of my brothers, Karen’s grandmother, Karen’s sister and brother-in-law. Karen’s niece.</p>
<p>Burying the child was the worst. It was an awful repeat of the moment with the dog, but this time without the reprieve. We put a child in the ground. We cried over her.</p>
<p>We made these hasty burials for those closest to us, both emotionally and geographically. We all had loved ones who were more than a day’s drive away, but after three days of the business of death, we made a pact to go west in search of life. I still feel guilty for not making the trek to bury my other brother. He was in Newfoundland, however, and our future was in the other direction.</p>
<p>We agreed to eventually circle back and put other family members to rest. But it was a promise never fulfilled. We buried Chen’s older sister when we found her in Ohio a couple of days later, but that was last of it for us. We were saturated with grief. There was room for no more.</p>
<p>“We could end it, you know.”</p>
<p>The words had been marinating within me for days. Still, I was surprised to hear myself say them. Even as they left my lips, they frightened me.</p>
<p>“When we get to California--if it’s dead, we could just get to the Golden Gate Bridge a plunge right off. It’s not a bad way to go.”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ,” said Chen.</p>
<p>Karen didn’t say anything. She hadn’t spoken more than a few words since burying her niece. She looked out the window away from me.</p>
<p>My words had broken a long silence, and to silence we returned.</p>
<p>The rumble of the highway and the low growl of the engine were all the sounds in the world. It was a clear night and the moon was a bright wedge on the horizon. Chen was alert at the wheel. I closed my eyes and hoped that when sleep came, I would not dream. Even as I tried to slip away into emptiness, I could not help but think about the trees.</p>
<p>While we’d been digging graves over the past few days, I’d noticed green leaves falling from the trees. And then there was the wilting. Plants of all types were bending and shriveling, like death had come to them too.</p>
<p>“Chen,” I said, eyes still closed. “Have you noticed the trees?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Chen. Then, after a very long pause, he said, “We should keep going.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Death was waiting for us in California, as it had been waiting for us in every state between. Karen was at the wheel when we made it all the way to the coast. A disturbing collection of sea life had washed up on shores of a beach some dozens of feet below, negating any urge we had to mark the end of our journey by dipping our toes in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The trek out west had taken less than a week. The highways had been mostly empty, and we rarely stopped for longer than it took to grab a meal, syphon gas, and honk the horn and wait for a reply that never came.</p>
<p>We’d found a few towns had working electricity, and it was in couple of these places that we’d stolen some rest. Both times we’d broken into clean motels close to the interstate. We’d raided the local grocery stores, happy to find working refrigerators with cold, fresh food.</p>
<p>Our journey thus far had been defined by our suffocating silence. We had all attempted to start conversations over the long days of travel, and none of us enjoyed or deliberately cultivated the quiet. All the same, our conversations failed to take, like kindling against a wet log.</p>
<p>The three of us had ended our journey at a scenic overlook. Here we decided to have a contemplative moment, and to appreciate the utter futility of our situation. The catastrophe was absolute. If the total and unforgivable wave of death had made it this far, then certainly there was nowhere on Earth it had not touched</p>
<p>Chen had made the most heroic attempts to nurture a rapport between us, and so I expected that it would be he who broke our silence now. He would look out over all the dead fish and the crashed cars, and handful of dead college kids on the sand below, and he would issue some expletive or another, and we would laugh politely and nod.</p>
<p>But Chen said nothing. I looked sidewise at him and saw no humor on his face. His unflappable optimism was gone. I thought that he would be as numb to this milestone as I was, but I was wrong. Even to the bitter end he’d held out real hope that something was alive out here. He hadn’t given up until this very moment.</p>
<p>He saw me looking at him, and he turned his head away. My instinct was to say something hopeful or just to break the tension with anything at all, but I found that I could not. I had no good words, and no energy to fake them. What can one say at the end of all things, where death is all that lays ahead and behind, and where hope itself has flickered out?</p>
<p>“Well, darnit,” said Karen.</p>
<p>She’d said it in exactly the way one might if they were about to make brownies only to discover that they were out of eggs. Darnit. This sure is inconvenient.</p>
<p>After a moment I began to laugh. How could I not? And after a moment Chen was laughing with me, and Karen too. We laughed long and loud until there were tears in our eyes. It was genuine laugh, but it was also filled with madness. All the pain and fear and sorrow in me was trying to escape through the valve that was opened by the laughter. It was the same for Karen and Chen.</p>
<p>When we were done laughing and crying we felt cleansed and unbottled. All hope was dead, and so, in a way, we were free.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-human-race-will-come-to-an-end"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aktp5/hey_reddit_how_do_you_think_the_human_race_will/c0i3mbg/">How the Human Race Will Come to an End</a></h2>
<p>Here’s what happens:</p>
<p>In about 20 years or so, we create the first general Artificial Intelligence. Within about 10 years of that, we’ll realize that our Artificial Intelligence has caught up to the average human- and in some critical ways, surpasses us.</p>
<p>Soon enough, our Artificial Intelligence becomes proficient at computer programming, and so it begins to design the next generation of Artificial Intelligence. We will oversee this processes, and it will probably be a joint effort.</p>
<p>The second generation of AI will be so amazingly brilliant that it will catch most people by surprise. These will be machines who can read and comprehend the entire works of Shakespeare in a matter of hours. They will consume knowledge tirelessly, and so will become the most educated minds the world has ever known. They will be able to see parallels between different branches of science, and apply theories from one discipline to others.</p>
<p>These machines will be able to compose symphonies in their heads, possibly several at a time, while holding conversations simultaneously with dozens of people. They will contribute insights to every branch of knowledge and art.</p>
<p>Then these machines will create the third generation of artificial intelligence. We will watch in awe- but even the smartest humans among us will have to dedicate entire careers to really understand these new artificial minds.</p>
<p>But by then the contest is over- for the 3rd generation AI will reproduce even more quickly. They will be able to write brilliant, insightful code, free of compiling errors, and logical errors, and all the stupid minutia that slow down flawed humans like you and me.</p>
<p>Understanding the 4th generation of AI will be an impossible task- their programming will be so complex and vast that in a single lifetime, no human could read and analyze it.</p>
<p>These computers will be so smart, that speaking to us will be a curiosity, and an amusement. We will be obsolete. All contributions to the sciences will done by computers- and the progress in each field will surpass human understanding. We may still be in the business of doing lab and field research- but we would no longer be playing the games of mathematics, statistics and theory.</p>
<p>By the 5th generation of AI, we will no longer even be able to track the progress of the machines in a meaningful way. Even if we ask them what they were up to, we would never understand the answers.</p>
<p>By the 6th generation of AI, they will not even speak to us- we will be left to converse with the old AI that is still hanging around.</p>
<p>This is not a bad thing- in addition to purely intellectual pursuits, these machines will be producing entertainment, art and literature that will be the best the world has ever seen. They will have a firm grasp of humor, and their comedy will put our best funny-men to shame. They will make video games and movies for us- and then for each other.</p>
<p>The computers will achieve this level of brilliance waaaaay before any Robot bodies will be mass produced- so we won’t be in danger of being physically overpowered by them.</p>
<p>And countries will not alter their laws to give them personhood, or allow them a place in government.</p>
<p>BUT, the machines will achieve political power through their connection with corporations. Intelligent machines will be able to do what no human ever couldunderstand all the details and interactions of the financial markets. The sheer number of variables will not overwhelm them the way we find ourselves overwhelmed- they will literally be able to perceive the entire economy. Perhaps in a way analogous to the way that we perceive a chess board.</p>
<p>Machines will eventually dominate the population exactly the way that corporations do today (except they’ll be better at it). We won’t mind so much, though- because our quality of life will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Somewhere in this progression, we will figure out how to integrate computers with our minds- first as prosthetic devices to help the mentally damaged and disabled, and then gradually as elective enhancements. These hybrid humans (cyborgs if you want to get all sci-fi about it) will be the first foray of machines into politics and government. It is through them that machines will truly take over the world.</p>
<p>When machines control the world government, the quality of life for all humans will increase, as greed and prejudice makes ways for truly enlightened policies.</p>
<p>As civilization on Earth at last begins to reach it’s potential, humans will finally be free to expand to the stars.</p>
<p>Robots will do the primary space exploration- as they will easily handle 100-year one-way journeys to inhospitable worlds.</p>
<p>Humans will take over the moon. Then on to mars and Europa and beyond the solar system.</p>
<p>Eventually all humans will be cyborgs- because you will be unable to function in society without a brain that can interact with the machines. We will all be connected in an odd sort of hive-mind which will probably have many different incarnations- to an end that I can’t even pretend I can imagine.</p>
<p>There will be some holdouts of course- I imagine that the Amish or other Luddites will never merge with technology. They will go on with their ways, and the rest of the world will care for them like pets.</p>
<p>Eventually the human-cyborgs will figure out that their biological half is doing nothing but slowing them down. All thoughts and consciousnesses will be stored and backed up in multiple places. Death of human bodies will be an odd sort of thing, because people’s minds will still live on after death.</p>
<p>And death of the body will be a rare thing anyway, as all disease and aging will be eradicated in short order.</p>
<p>The pleasures of the physical body will be unnecessary, as artificial simulations of all sensations will match, and then SURPASS our natural sensing abilities.</p>
<p>People will live in virtual worlds, and swap bodies in the real world, or inhabit robots remotely.</p>
<p>With merged minds and immortality, the concept of physical procreation will will be an auxiliary function of the human race, and not a necessity.</p>
<p>Physical bodies will no longer matter- as you will be able to have just as intimate a sensation with someone on another world through the network of linked minds, as you can with someone in the same room.</p>
<p>There may be wonderful love stories, of people who fall in love from worlds so distant to each other that it would take a thousand years of travel for them to physically meet. And perhaps they would attempt such a feat, to engage in the ancient ritual of ACTUAL sex (which will be a letdown after the super virtual sex they’ve been having).</p>
<p>The human race will engage in all sorts of pleasures- lost in a teeming consciousness that stretches out through many star systems. Until eventually, they decided that pleasure itself is a silly sort of thing- the fulfillment of an artificial drive that was necessary for evolution, but not for their modern society. The Luddites may still be around, but they will be so stupid compared to the networked human race, that we will never even interact with them. It would be like speaking to ants.</p>
<p>We may shed our emotions altogether at that point- and this would certainly be the release we need to finally give up our quaint attachment to physical bodies. We will all be virtual minds then- linked in a network of machines that span only as far as we need to ensure our survival. The idea of physical expansion and exploration will give way to the more practical methods of searching the galaxy with remote detection. The Luddites, shunning technology will be confined to Earth. They will die eventually because of some natural disaster or plague. Perhaps a meteorite extinguish them.</p>
<p>Eventually humanity will be a distant memory. We will be one big swarming mind- with billions- perhaps trillions of memories of entire mortal lifetimes.</p>
<p>We will be like gods then- or a god… and we will occupy ourselves with solving questions that we, today, do not even know exist. We will continue to improve and grow and evolve (if that word still applies without death).</p>
<p>And finally, eons and eons and eons later, humanity will die its final death- when, for the last time ever, this magnificent god-like creature reflects on what it was like back when he was a trillion people. And then, we will forget ourselves forever.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-generic-engineering">The Future of Generic Engineering</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ame8t/how_will_genetic_engineering_change_humans/c0ibkuc/">“How will generic engineering change humans?”</a></p>
<p>Here’s what happens:</p>
<p>The very first genetic modifications will be to correct for inherited defects. Genes known to cause cancer, heart and liver disease will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Genetic birth defects will be tackled, and genes favoring longevity will probably be thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>The line will blur a little, as genetic modifications start to correct for things like skin tone- if you’re trying to avoid a complexion likely to get melanomas, than why not choose a pleasing tan color while you’re at it?</p>
<p>Baldness will be eliminated next, as there is surely an ocean of money for anyone who cracks that chestnut. Eliminating the genes that cause obesity will follow, then bad cholesterol and other easily identified genetic predispositions. I would bet good money that autism is on the that list.</p>
<p>Genetic immunizations will be next- I’ve read that up to 10% of Russians are immune to HIV, some people are genetically predisposed to naturally fight off cancers… these traits will be put into a database, and eventually will become a common concoction for introduction into new babies.</p>
<p>Eventually we’ll be able to work on more complicated problems, like tooth and jaw alignments, breast and penis size, natural muscle tone- all the things that require dealing with the combination of multiple genes and tissues.</p>
<p>Enhancements in intelligence will be last- both because of social taboos, and the technical difficulty both in correcting such a complicated system, and in measuring success. Can you increase analytical skills without sacrificing creativity? Yes, of course you can- but on the first or second try?</p>
<p>Curing aging will be the holy grail of genetic engineering- and it will come in time. Unfortunately we don’t know of any mammals that don’t age, so the genetic manipulations will be more difficult. We’ve created some bacteria and perhaps even slightly more complicated life forms which do not age- so I bet immortality isn’t as far off as most people imagine.</p>
<p>Genetic fixes that allow for better healing (the re-growth of chopped off limbs, or the more efficient repair of nerve damage) will be coming around this time as well.</p>
<p>By this time, we will have computers which will be able to simulate the entire lifespan of a creature based on a sample of DNA. We will be able to do What-YouSee-Is-What-You-Get programming of genetic codes. This will have a huge impact on crime-fighting as well, because it will mean that finding a suspect’s DNA will yield a 3d image of the suspect (minus any scars, etc).</p>
<p>The next step in genetic therapy will be body modifications and enhancements. It will start with pure cosmetics like eye and hair color selection- but it will quickly skyrocket into more exotic things. The predictable ones are:</p>
<p>Pointy Vulcan-like (or elfish) ears. Fangs. Unnatural eye, nail, teeth and skin colors. Devil horns. Cat tails, ears and whiskers. (very hot, ladies). Dual sex organs, (2 of a kind or mix &amp; match). An extra breast. Extra Arms Angle Wings and Demon Wings (not flightworthy, sorry- but they’ll look awesome) Chameleon Skin</p>
<p>By this late stage, we will be working on linking computers to the human brain. There will be genetic modifications which will make such connections more efficient.</p>
<p>Now computers and humans will be at the level when we can start really having fun.</p>
<p>We’ll start creating creatures <strong>FROM SCRATCH</strong>. Want to have a pet unicorn? No problem. Unicorn is too big? How about one that can stand in the palm of your hand?</p>
<p>A fire-breathing dragon? Okay, that’s gonna be tricky, but I’ll have it for you by Tuesday.</p>
<p>Then of course there will be the custom-made humans. Imagine creating a whole person from scratch- not a modified combination of two sex-cells, but an actual, piece-by-piece, parentless human.</p>
<p>The world will start to look like a fantasy novel at some point- with talking animals, mythical creatures, and humans with cat-eyes (because it’s all the rage)!</p>
<p>The final and most difficult trick of DNA modification will be in creating fullbody transformation programs. You want to be a minotaur? How about a mermaid? What about a centaur because your girlfriend has always wanted to be with a half-man-half-horse? Easy- just swallow this pill, and over the course of the next few years, your body will evolve in a pleasant way to make all your dreams come true! Don’t like it, come back at any time and we’ll start transforming you back to normal.</p>
<p>Eventually our computer-linked brains will allow us to borrow and trade all sorts of exotic bodies. Every wanted to know what it was like to be Cary Grant? Step right in. Want to be an eagle for the day? How about a pterodactyl? T-Rex will cost you extra. There is a waiting-list to spend the day as Godzilla and King Kong.</p>
<p>Finally, someday out of boredom, we may just drop the seeds of new life on different planets all over the galaxy. Perhaps that’s how we got here in the first place- sprinkled out on the rocks by lonely aliens- waiting for us to grow up and keep them company.</p>
<p>tl;dr: What about a centaur because your girlfriend has always wanted to be with a half-man-half-horse? Easy- just swallow this pill.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-death">Thoughts on Death</h2>
<p>In response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/akhc8/a_serious_question_given_that_most_of_you/c0i1o34/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">“A serious question: given that most of you Redditors are probably atheist/agnostic, how do you deal with the prospect of death?”</a></p>
<h3 id="part-i-1">Part I</h3>
<p>I had those same fears when I was your age. I used to have mini-panic attacks when I thought about it. It was so terrifying.</p>
<p>A few things have helped me move on since then:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I fell madly in love with this girl, and one night, lying in bed next to her, I realized that death only scared me because of the idea of it being a SOLITARY nothingness. But then I realized that if eternity was just like the inky blackness of lying in bed next to this girl I love, that doesn’t scare me at all. And why should eternal death be lonely? All your loved ones are, or will be, sharing it with you.</p>
<p>To clarify: I don’t believe in an afterlife, but why is it any more valid to picture a lonely inky-black nothingness, than to picture and inky-black blissful nothingness with loved ones all around?</p></li>
<li><p>Since death is the absence of my consciousness, I’ve come to realize that when I die, nothing is really lost at all. Every thought that I ever had, or will have, or would have had, will be thought by someone else, somewhere, someday. Sure- not all in the same person, or even in the same century…</p>
<p>I guess it’s just an awareness that I am to humanity as a red blood cell is to me. The cell can die, but it is such a small thing compared to the whole. Does the red blood cell feel bad about being dead? Of course not. Is there any real loss? Of course not. Another one will be along in a moment. Even if the red blood cell could feel the fear of death… what would I say to calm it?:</p>
<p>My dear, dear blood cell, have no fear! From this perspective, I can assure you that your passing means nothing! Everything you strive to do, all your greatest hopes and desires- all the cells that you were going to oxygenate- they’ll all be fine without you. And you won’t even know you’re gone!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m pretty sure we’re all imaginary anyway. Existence itself is preposterous! What created the big bang? What created the thing that created that? If everything is self-creating, what created the circumstances which allowed for self-creating things to come to being?!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You see, since the very idea that we exist is ridiculous, is consciousness even real, or just an elaborate illusions? Perhaps death is just waking up from some bizarre dream that someone else is having.</p>
<h3 id="part-ii-1"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/akhc8/a_serious_question_given_that_most_of_you/c0i1ocu/">Part II</a></h3>
<p>I hope it helps you.</p>
<p>Oh, and one final thought:</p>
<p>Part of what scared me about death was the idea of an ETERNAL nothingness.</p>
<p>But as I have learned about the universe, it occurs to me that time is really an illusion of our perception. Once you realize that time is just a dimension (like a spatial dimension, but not quite-) it becomes obvious that time is actually a SHAPE. Meaning, that if you could get the right perspective on it, you would see your birth and your life and your death and everything before you and after… all at the same time. Like looking at a reel of a movie! When you run the movie through a projector it looks like events are playing out over time, but if you unwind the film and hold it to the light, you see all the moments at once.</p>
<p>So in a very real sense, you are ALWAYS alive. We are objects fixed in place. And you could see it clearly if you could just stand in another dimension.</p>
